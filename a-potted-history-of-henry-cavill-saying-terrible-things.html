The Telegraph’s Tim Robey even called it “the blockbuster of the summer”. All of which means we’re likely to hear more from Henry Cavill, the lantern-jawed sensitive superhero star who rose to fame after playing Superman in Man of Steel.</p><p>Once in the spotlight, Cavill made sure he stayed there by <a href=#>saying an increasing number of preposterous things</a> – and as recent comments would attest, he won’t be stopping soon. Here’s a potted history:</p><h4>June 2013</h4><p>“It’s hidden and locked away. I was very good about that. You don’t want to do that, because you respect the costume so much. You’re not just taking photos of yourself saying, “Hey, look!” because you know there’s going to be some berk out there who will then post it online and think he’s really funny, and you’re like, “Yeah thanks, there goes my career.”<br><strong>Cavill steadfastedly refuses to see the humour in Nick Grimshaw’s approach for <a href=#>BBC Radio One</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Yeah! What, are you crazy? God, all those people who say, ‘Oh no, the money doesn’t matter.’ Yeah, right. They’re either mad, or they’re lying. I mean, come on. ‘Oh no, don’t pay me anything, it’s for the arts.’ I'm sorry, no. Pay me the money. I’m not doing it for charity. I’m not a nonprofit organisation. Plus it’s expensive flying back and forward to LA. You need a job that pays money.”<br><strong>Cavill was unabashed about his enjoyment of money to <a href=#>GQ</a> in 2013.</strong></p><p>At one point, Cavill tells me, he got so big, he split his Clark Kent suit… “The seams,” he says, laughing, “were ripping in the trousers.” … He would, he says, look in the mirror and ask himself one question: “Is it enough?”<br><strong>From GQ, on Cavill’s increasing muscular heft.</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>As Superman</span></figure><h4>August 2015</h4><p>“Armie, Guy and myself are comfortable with our sexuality, so we’re not fearful of coming across as homosexual. A lot of straight guys would be like, ‘Oh, that’s a bit gay, I’m not doing that.’ But I’ll happily stand with my arm around my best mate in a pub. Not a problem.”<br><strong>On his raging hetereosexuality to The Guardian.</strong></p><p>“It’s like shagging someone for the first time. Sometimes it turns out to be amazing. Mostly you’re trying to get each other’s rhythm going. It’s on the next go that you start to expand. That’s why I do it. That and the money.”<br><strong>Once again, Cavill discusses his enormous salary and applies a new analogy to the complexities of playing a fictional superhero.</strong></p><h4>February 2016</h4><p>“Do you want to be famous? Then you shouldn’t be an actor. If you’re trying to be famous, you’ve lost before you’ve even begun. You might as well apply for [the reality series] Big Brother.”<br><strong>In which Cavill specifies to DuJour magazine that he is in acting for the money, but definitely not for the fame.</strong></p><h4>March 2016</h4><p>“I’m not just doing this for the art. The money’s fantastic and that’s something which I deem – and again, it is frowned upon – very important. People will be calling me a c---&nbsp;as they’re reading this, but travel’s great as long as you’re going first class. I mean, traveling to New Zealand in economy, it sucks. Especially if you’re over six feet. But first class? I’m not going to ever pretend to be coy about that. I love it.”<br><strong>Despite discussing it extensively before, Cavill attracted global attention for admitting to Man of the World magazine that he appeared in Hollywood films largely for the cash, and then explained all the different ways his life was better because he was rich now.</strong></p><p>“Maybe the solution is to have more diversity in the members. But does that mean we are saying that to have more black academy members would result in more black nominations? Is that not racist itself?"<br><strong>Cavill couldn’t really have held a more blinkered opinion with regards to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. Since 2016, the Academy have been trying to consistently boost their diversity by inviting hundreds of new members from non-white backgrounds to the institution.</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Cavill in 2016</span></figure><p>“I do think there’s a bit of a double standard, you know. I mean, if a girl shouts something like ‘Oi, love, fancy a shag?’ to me as I walk past I do sometimes wonder how she’d feel if a builder said that to her. Although, of course, I wouldn’t feel physically threatened, as she might… I don’t mind it – not unless I’m with my girlfriend and someone is being complimentary to me in order to disrespect her. People who don’t respect other people’s feelings really get my goat.”<br><strong>Cavill gets tangled up in the politics of sexual harassment for <a href=#>The Sunday Times</a>.</strong></p><p>“[A director] joked he wanted an eight-pack, not six. That sort of thing isn’t in your contract – it doesn’t need to be, because they can give you muscles with CGI. But I take pride in doing it myself.”<br><strong>In which he shows off his muscle integrity to the paper.</strong></p><h4>July 2018</h4><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Cavill impresses the ladies</span></figure><p>“There’s something wonderful about a man chasing a woman. There’s a traditional approach to that, which is nice. I think a woman should be wooed and chased, but maybe I’m old-fashioned for thinking that.</p><p>“It’s very difficult to do that if there are certain rules in place. Because then it’s like: ‘Well, I don’t want to go up and talk to her, because I’m going to be called a rapist or something’. So you’re like, ‘Forget it, I’m going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked’. But it’s way safer than casting myself into the fires of hell, because I’m someone in the public eye, and if I go and flirt with someone, then who knows what’s going to happen?</p><p>“Now? Now you really can’t pursue someone further than, ‘No’. It’s like, ‘OK, cool’. But then there’s the, ‘Oh why’d you give up?’ And it’s like, ‘Well, because I didn’t want to go to jail?’”<br><strong>On the #MeToo movement, to Australian GQ. Cavill later issued an apology “for any confusion and misunderstanding that this may have created. Insensitivity was absolutely not my intention”.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJ6Zobq0e5FpaHFnYGx8cn%2BOoZynqqlisKLCyKWjZq%2Bfp8C1edaoqaysXabCsMDErGShoaOpvLPFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
