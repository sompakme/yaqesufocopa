Back in June, 2019, she tied the knot with <strong>Olympic bobsledder Viktor Rajek</strong>. Amid all the new publicity his wife has gotten, it would be interesting to know what he thinks about his last name being used so much in the same sentence as Tom Brady. <strong><a href=#>Derek Jeter</a></strong> recently spoke about these rumors and how he needs to keep his mouth shut when they aren't true. Stuff like this happens all the time and the Rajek family has been affected.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Veronika Rajek gushing over Tom Brady?

Since then, Rajek has retired and he is currently a restaurant owner. Located in Vienna, Austria, Rajek owns the exclusive Bier & Bierli restaurant. Like his wife, Viktor has an impressive educational background. He is a Business graduate of the Ohio-based college University of Akron. This news leaves many of Tom Brady's fans eager to find a new partner for him, given that Veronika Rajek is actually married.</p><p>Ever since the rumors started, neither Veronika Rajek nor Tom Brady have publicly spoken about any of this. Viktor Rajek must be laughing at all the rumors coming from various American media outlets that are eager to find Tom Brady a new girlfriend. For now, the Tampa Bay QB is focused on finishing the season and probably not thinking about a serious relationship. However, it's impossible Tom is not going out and having fun with absolutely anybody. Pro athletes always have friends with benefits but they keep it top secret in order to avoid rumors from the press. It is a little strange that no pictures of <strong>Viktor Rajek</strong> can be found on Veronika's IG profile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJnfHJ%2BjmtoaG5jloB1gsKfmppsZ2l%2BebCPbW%2BbbGWYfW%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
