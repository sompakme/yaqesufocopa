There are some requirements you have to meet, and knowing how to calculate UI cut off mark is the first thing to do.</p><p class=align-left>Thus, to be eligible for post JAMB exams you should be the candidate with the following results:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stanbic IBTC Pension: Every ‘Someday’ needs a plan</span></p></a><ul><li>UTME points of at least 200 or better more</li><li>UI has to be the number 1 choice of your university</li><li>Your O’level points should be at least C6 or higher</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg><h3>Cut Off Mark Calculation for University of Ibadan</h3><p class=align-left>Each UI cut off mark is easily calculated using a formula. We will explain this in details. Post UTME maximum score is 100%. Now let us understand what you have to add up to get the final point:</p><ul><li>Post UTME score you have earned has to be divided by two</li><li>JAMB points are divided by eight</li></ul><p class=align-left>Before you add everything up to get your UI cut off mark in percent, let us look at this simple illustration. For example, you have scored 280 (out of 400) points at JAMB and 66 (out of 100) at post UTME.</p><p class=align-left>We have to divide 280 by 8 which equals 35; and we should also divide 66 by 2 which equals 33. Now let us just sum both numbers 35 plus 33 and we will get 68. You receive this percent or 68%.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b524fb8024e3fad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rapper Kanye West to give back his music artistes 50% of their masters</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now you know your post UTME aggregate score, so you have to just compare it to the University of Ibadan cut off mark and you will know if you have been lucky to study here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6uv61ealoss.jpg><h3>UI Cut Off Mark for Departments</h3><p class=align-left>These are approximate cut off marks for University of Ibadan’s departments, so you can get an idea if your aggregate score is close to what is required by this institution or not.</p><h4>Faculty of Agriculture</h4><ul><li>Economics – your points should be more than 51%</li><li>Rural development – the average score has to be higher than 52%</li><li>Animal science – the starting point is around 52%</li><li>Environmental biology and agronomics – the cut off mark is approximately 54%-54.5%</li></ul><h4>Faculty of Arts</h4><ul><li>Classical studies – you have to score at least 57-61%</li><li>Anthropology – your points have to be higher than 54-57%</li><li>Archaeology – students are expected to reach 50-52% or more</li><li>Arabic literature & language – your score has to be around 50-59%</li><li>English literature & language – you need to score at least 58-65%</li><li>Language arts – you have to earn 63-68% or more</li><li>Russian language – candidates should score 50-55%</li><li>French language – you need to get approximately 55-63%</li><li>German language – the expected score is around 50-59%</li><li>Islamic studies – your expected cut off mark is 50-54%</li><li>History – the cut off points are 56-60%</li><li>Yoruba studies – students should get approximately 50-55%</li><li>Linguistics – UI cut off mark for this discipline is 57-63%</li><li>Music – candidate’s score should be at least 57-59%</li><li>Theater arts – you have to get the average score of 59-64% or higher</li><li>Philosophy – candidates have to earn 53-62%</li><li>Religious studies – you need to get 50-53%</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9da79168c0c6d0d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>We are not hiding again -
