The Chicago Tribune confirmed his death, citing ampullary cancer, a rare form that affects an area near the bile duct and pancreas, as the cause. This blog post will delve into his life, accomplishments, and lasting legacy.</p><h2><strong>Early Years and Education</strong></h2><p>Born in Shanghai, China, in 1936, Mars Williams was the child of Australian-born Chinese-British parents. Raised in Hong Kong, he attended primary and high school, experiencing the loss of his mother to breast cancer at the age of 12. This event inspired his pursuit of a medical career.</p><p>In 1951, Williams relocated to Sydney, Australia, staying with extended family. He completed his education at Christian Brothers’ High School in Lewisham and later graduated from the University of Sydney in 1962 with a Bachelor of Medical Science with First-Class Honours and a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery.</p><h2><strong>Medical Journey</strong></h2><p>Following his education, Williams interned at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney under cardiac surgeon Mark Shanahan. He then worked in London with British surgeon Aubrey York Mason, a pioneer in coronary artery bypass surgery, and in the United States, learning from leading heart transplantation experts.</p><p>Returning to Australia in 1972, Williams joined St Vincent’s Hospital as a cardiothoracic surgeon. He played a key role in establishing the National Cardiac Transplant Unit, achieving Australia’s first successful heart transplant in 1984. Williams conducted groundbreaking work, including the country’s first pediatric heart transplant.</p><p>Williams and his team garnered widespread respect for their success in heart transplantations. Additionally, he contributed to medical advancements by inventing an artificial heart valve with his team in Singapore. At the time of his death, he was actively involved in developing an artificial heart device.</p><h2><strong>Accolades and Recognition</strong></h2><p>Williams received numerous awards and honors for his exceptional contributions, including being appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1986. He received accolades such as the Medal of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, the Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. Nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1991, he was also voted Australian of the Century in 1999.</p><p>In 2001, Williams appeared on the Australian $100 banknote, and he was inducted into the Australian National Living Treasures list in 2004. The Australian newspaper recognized him as one of the 100 most influential Australians in 2006.</p><h2><strong>Tragic End and Legacy</strong></h2><p>On July 4, 1991, Williams met a tragic end when he was shot twice in the head in a failed extortion attempt. The nation was shocked, and a massive manhunt ensued for the perpetrators. The killers, Phillip Lim and Chiew Seng Liew, were arrested, tried, and convicted. Williams was mourned by his family, colleagues, and admirers, receiving a state funeral attended by dignitaries.</p><p>Williams’ legacy endures through the Victor Chang Foundation, established by his family and supporters to fund cardiovascular disease research and education. The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, a leading biomedical research center, stands as a testament to his vision. The Victor Chang Lowy Packer Building at St Vincent’s Hospital, named in his honor, houses the National Cardiac Transplant Unit and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.</p><p>Dr. Victor Chang, a pioneer of heart transplantation and a compassionate figure in the medical field, leaves behind a lasting impact on humanity. His contributions to science, his dedication to saving lives, and his enriching influence on Australian culture ensure that he will be remembered always.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s63LpaqhnV6YvK57zJqprGWnnrmttcCmqmaclZbBqXnSmq%2BoqJiku6q%2F02amn2WknbJuvNKymqGdlJq5qq%2BMn6yrq12Wu6V5y6KorqGUYsCwwctmm6Kdo2KutXmVcWSfqp%2BieqStzZycq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
