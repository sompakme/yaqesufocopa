I’m properly middle-aged now.’ All parts of life feel extremely activated.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Within the interview, Gerwig is described as stepping away to pump breastmilk and shares a photo of her newest child during a recent four-month check-up. “He’s a little Schmoo. I don’t know if you can tell energy from the picture, but that’s very much his energy,” she said. “The little guy is sleeping through the night. But I’m still doing that thing where I wake up, every hour to 90 minutes, and just hover. You just keep wanting to look at that baby. So I’m slightly in a twilight state.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The interview marks the first time Gerwig or Baumbach have discussed the birth of their second son. The Oscar-nominated writer and director of Lady Bird announced she was pregnant for the second time back in December 2022 during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Early in the sit-down, Fallon teased Gerwig had news, with the director responding, “Yes, I am with child,” to audience cheers and applause.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeXp7K1rYygnKuvmZx6r7vAoWSbmaWir6Kvx2aunqSTpLqmedKemqimlGKwqbXLnWRqamNqgnSFl29raA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
