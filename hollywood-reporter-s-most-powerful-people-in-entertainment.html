Through mergers (Disney and Fox), buyouts (AT&T gobbling up Time Warner) and an arms race for talent ($250 million for J.J. Abrams?), the upper echelon of the content business has never been more influential or fabulously compensated. With that in mind, this is The Hollywood Reporter 100, the fourth annual ranked list of the most powerful people in entertainment.</p><p>While Disney CEO Bob Iger retains his status as No. 1 (acquiring the $71.3 billion Fox assets and generating a record $8 billion at the box office make that choice an easy one), moving up on the list are figures from Shari Redstone (No. 4), who'll see the Viacom-CBS merger she masterminded come to fruition this year, to Marvel Studios’ Kevin Feige (No. 5), the most important Disney employee not named Iger, and Ava DuVernay (No.59), who jumps nearly 30 slots on the strength of her creative clout, Emmy nominations and leadership in Hollywood's gender parity and inclusion efforts.</p><p>Hitting the list for the first time are Barack and Michelle Obama (No. 50), whose Higher Ground shingle is making waves via deals with Netflix and Spotify, along with Aquaman helmer James Wan (No. 80) and Hustlers star-producer Jennifer Lopez (No. 92). They're all among the 32 new names shaking up the entertainment world — but perhaps no single figure has had more seismic impact than David Young (No. 93), executive director of the WGA West, who has led the guild's fight with the talent agencies over affiliate production and packaging fees (and caused the agency leaders to tumble a few spots on the list.)&nbsp;</p><p>As the Streaming Wars further disrupt Hollywood hierarchies and upend conventional wisdom about audiences, creators and distributors, THR's annual list captures the dynamic landscape of entertainment power now. These are the haves.&nbsp;</p><p>Methodology: During a months-long process, editors compiled the THR 100 based on the size and reach of a person's purview, the success of his or her work since 2018's list, the power to get a project made (company ownership helps) and the ineffables: heat, clout and intangible indicators of influence gleaned from conversations with dozens of top insiders (not to mention THR’s daily reporting).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/thr100-embed2x.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Profiles written by&nbsp;Seth Abramovitch, Paul Bond, Rebecca Ford, Mia Galuppo, Stephen Galloway, Lesley Goldberg, Marisa Guthrie, Jonathan Handel, Natalie Jarvey, Rebecca Keegan, Borys Kit, Pamela McClintock, Michael O’Connell, Bryn Elise Sandberg, Tatiana Siegel, Piya Sinha-Roy, Rebecca Sun and Benjamin Svetkey.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Taika Waititi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/thr100-embed2x.png><p>After exceeding critical and commercial expectations with Thor: Ragnarok, the New Zealand filmmaker, 44, returned to his indie roots for Fox Searchlight's Jojo Rabbit.

A major test will be the 2020 launch of WarnerMedia's streamer, HBO Max.</p><p><strong>IF YOU COULD CONTROL ONE PIECE OF IP, WHAT WOULD IT BE?</strong></p><p>"We have an amazing collection of IP already, but&nbsp;I suspect James Bond might be enough to pull me out of my hands-off approach to the greenlight process!"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GO-TO PODCAST FOR A LONG DRIVE</strong></p><p>"If not a book on tape, The Bill Simmons Podcast."</p><p><strong>THE LAST APP SOMEONE UNDER 13 HAD TO EXPLAIN TO YOU</strong></p><p>"If it has to be explained, I probably shouldn't be using it."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Kevin Feige</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gettyimages-1034573612-h_2019.jpg><p>It's Feige's cinematic universe, we just live in it. The most important Disney employee not named Iger and arguably the most successful film producer of all time, Feige began 2019 at the Oscars with the first superhero movie (Black Panther) to be nominated for best picture. The $1.1 billion launch of Marvel's first female-headlining movie,&nbsp;Captain Marvel, was a prelude to Avengers: Endgame, which with $2.8 billion overtook&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;to become the biggest movie of all time. Feige, 46, was at the center of a studio fight over a sequel to yet another one of his 2019 billion-dollar babies,&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;(the outcome: Marvel will complete the Sony trilogy). Now he's plotting the integration of Marvel properties acquired via the Fox acquisition and a trip to the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;universe.</p><img width=928 height=1392 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image00001-embed_2019_thr.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Shari Redstone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bob_bakish_and_joe_ianniello-_split-_getty-h_2019.jpg><p>After an epic battle worthy of an HBO drama to unite Viacom and CBS, Redstone, 65, emerged unscathed and in control of the soon-to-be-combined media behemoth. But over the past year, Viacom's stock has dropped from $32.78 to $22.50, while CBS' has fallen more precipitously, from $57.44 to $37.64 (still, ViacomCBS will enjoy a huge slice of the U.S. TV audience, at about 22 percent compared with Comcast's 18 percent). And with the new company valued at about $31 billion (compared with AT&T-WarnerMedia's $255 billion or Netflix's $125 billion), expect Redstone to embark on a media assets shopping spree.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Brian Roberts and Steve Burke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mayershell.jpg><p>Roberts, 60, couldn't outbid Disney for 21st Century Fox, but he did manage to wrest European entertainment giant Sky from Rupert Murdoch, paying $38.8 billion for a majority stake and prompting Murdoch to unload his share for $15 billion. With Sky making up the third leg of Roberts' empire — joining Comcast Cable and NBCU — the company now has 184,000 employees and brings in more than $110 billion annually. Second-quarter revenue missed estimates, but it also was the fourth consecutive quarter for which Comcast beat earnings-per-share estimates; the stock has spiked more than 30 percent this year. Burke's NBCUniversal, with $8.2 billion in revenue for the second quarter, saw broadcast and cable edge up, while film declined 15 percent primarily due to a 53 percent drop in theatrical compared with the strength of 2018 hits like&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The company enters the streaming arms race in April with Peacock, its ad-supported product. And Burke, 61, having recently shuffled Peacock's team (bringing in longtime Comcast exec Matt Strauss), has been writing big checks for content including licensing deals for&nbsp;Parks and Recreation, Battlestar Galactica&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Office, for which it shelled out $500 million for five years (beginning in 2021), depriving Netflix of one of its most popular programs.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=19><h2>Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/disney.jpg><p>Even as Disney, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal enter the streaming fray, the original disrupter — with nearly 152 million global subscribers and a 2019 content budget estimated at up to $15 billion — enjoys a massive head start. And Hastings, 59, and Sarandos, 55, now have an army of top creatives (among them&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;duo David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Ryan Murphy, Beyoncé and the Obamas). But with more than $10 billion in debt and a maturing market, the duo who revolutionized viewing may need to put sustainability over spending as the company's market capitalization — $125 billion at press time — has been battered by a subscriber miss (in the U.S., Netflix lost 130,000 subs in the second quarter). A new test will come with a second Oscar best picture campaign (The Irishman,&nbsp;Marriage Story&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Two Popes&nbsp;are favorites) after the top prize eluded&nbsp;Roma.</p><p><strong>A TOP TALENT (NOT ON YOUR PLATFORM) WHOM YOU ADMIRE</strong></p><p>Hastings: Amy Sherman-Palladino</p><p>Sarandos: "Billie Eilish is fascinating."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IF YOU COULD CONTROL ONE PIECE OF IP, WHAT WOULD IT BE?</strong></p><p>Hastings: "Too tough to pick just one."</p><p>Sarandos: "Already excited about creating in the worlds of Roald Dahl and C.S.

The most powerful person in Hollywood (for the fourth year in a row) presides over the industry’s largest and most influential entertainment business, with a market cap of around $234 billion and an unrivaled collection of IP and brands. And in 2019, Disney got a lot bigger. The March addition of $71.3 billion worth of 21st Century Fox assets positions the Mouse House as a content behemoth for the Streaming Wars, which may begin in earnest with the Nov. 12 launch of Disney+, Iger’s bold bet on the future of the 96-year-old company. Iger, 68, has convinced Disney investors that forgoing billions in TV licensing dollars will pay off with a global direct-to-consumer business featuring Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and Disney Animation films, plus original series like The Mandalorian and all 30 seasons of The Simpsons for $7 per month. Disney+, he says, "is going to be a priority for the foreseeable future for the company." In the meantime, Iger’s film studio has executed an unprecedented run at the box office: Disney has five of the year's top 10 films and has brought in $8 billion in box office revenue, a new record, with Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker still to come. But the year hasn't been without challenges, including layoffs that resulted from the integration of Fox assets, soft initial attendance at Disneyland's Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge attraction, and a $353 million write-down on the company's Vice investment. Still, in modern Hollywood, there's no one who mixes business vision with creative chops quite like Iger. Oh, and last month he became a best-selling author with his memoir,&nbsp;The Ride of a Lifetime.
