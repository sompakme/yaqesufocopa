The satirical psychological horror film follows wealthy New York City investment banking executive Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends. Throughout the pic he becomes more entangled in his violent and self-indulgent fantasies.
Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis, Matt Ross, Bill Sage, Chloe Sevigny, Cara Seymour, Justin Theroux, Guinevere Turner&nbsp;and Reese Witherspoon rounded out the cast of the Mary Harron-directed film. <a href=../../../christian-bale-jared-leto-more.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../deniro-farrar-explains-the-uplifting-nature-of-cult-rap.html>Deniro Farrar Explains The Uplifting Nature Of Cult Rap</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

It was puzzling because he was referenced by other Odd Future members constantly, although always through the same mystic (catch) phrase, "Free Earl."
