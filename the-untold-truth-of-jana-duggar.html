It's a bit less common, however, for an NFL star to be supposedly hooking up with a lesser known reality star a la TLC. Although this type of pairing might seem odd to some, rumors <a href=#>swirled</a> in 2014 that Jana and former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow were an item. Apparently, the gossip reached a fever pitch after Jim Bob met Tebow's mother, Pat Tebow, at a charity event for&nbsp;Loving Pregnancy Centers in 2014. "A great lady and a great cause! We enjoyed hearing Pam Tebow share tonight," Jim Bob <a href=#>captioned</a> a November 2014 Facebook photo taken at the event.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, the dating rumors made sense because both Jana and Tebow are deeply religious and they're two years apart in age. Plus, many fans were right to theorize that Jim Bob might have tried to get Jana and Tebow together via Pat â€” it's not like the patriarch hasn't <a href=#>set up</a> his daughters before, after all.</p><p>Unfortunately for excited fans, however, Tebow's rep denied the romance in December 2014, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. Making matters even more uncomfortable is that Jana's brother-in-law, Ben Seewald, made an awkward joke about Tebow possibly joining the Duggar clan just two months after the denial. "I'd definitely have him on my team," Seewald said about the possibility of playing family football with Tebow, according to People. "We'd win every time." Well, a guy can dream.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjZ315e9Snq6iklGLBs8HToWSjmZ6WeqXBxqCYq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
