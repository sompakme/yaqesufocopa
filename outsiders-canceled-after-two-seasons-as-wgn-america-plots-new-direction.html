Producers Sony Pictures Television plan to shop the series, which was developed specifically for <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=2>WGN</span> America, in the coming weeks.</p><p>“After three years of investing in marquee, brand-defining dramas, <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=6>WGN</span> America has successfully expanded its audience, its reach and its presence in the minds of viewers.&nbsp;In our next phase, we intend to expand our original and unique content to continue growing our relevance and appeal to the widest possible audience,” Kern said Friday in a statement to <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=128>THR</span>.&nbsp;“To achieve this, we will be reallocating our resources to a more diverse programming&nbsp;strategy and to new structures, enabling us to expand both the quantity and breadth of content aired by <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=8>WGN</span> America. This move is designed to deliver even more value to our advertising and distribution partners. To free up the resources to reach this goal, we will unfortunately not be renewing Outsiders. We are grateful to our production partners at Sony Pictures Television and the terrifically talented people who made the show possible.”</p><p>The cancelation comes as a surprise as the Peter <span data-scayt_word=Mattei-created data-scaytid=17>Mattei-created</span> drama starring David Morse, Joe Anderson and Ryan Hurst ranks as <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=14>WGN</span> America’s most-watched scripted original with an average of 2 million total viewers. The network is fresh off its second consecutive quarter of growth and its best quarter in primetime in seven years among total viewers and adults 35-54. &nbsp;</p><p>Outsiders was one of a small handful of scripted originals at <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=26>WGN</span> America. The cancelation leaves <span data-scayt_word="WGNA's" data-scaytid=140>WGNA’s</span> slate with slave drama Underground, a critical darling co-produced by Sony Pictures Television and Tribune Studios. The network previously handed out a straight-to-series order for&nbsp;a <a href=#>Ten Commandments</a> miniseries, though it has not aired. On the pilot side, the <span data-scayt_word=cabler data-scaytid=44>cabler</span> is readying DC Comics take <a href=#>Scalped</a> and recently passed on <a href=#>Roadside Picnic</a>.</p><p>Outsiders becomes the third scripted original to be canceled at <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=54>WGN</span> America, joining <a href=#>Salem</a> — its first in the space — and <a href=#>Manhattan</a>.</p><p>For <span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=64>WGN</span> America, the decision to pivot in a new scripted direction comes at a crucial time in the industry. With more than 450 scripted originals on broadcast, cable, premium and streaming, the competition for eyeballs has become fiercely competitive for fringe networks without a signature hit to build on. Fringe networks like Esquire (which recently shuttered its linear network in favor of a digital platform) are starting to vanish from the landscape amid growing concerns for an a la carte world.&nbsp;</p><p>For Tribune, the decision comes months after Kern replaced Peter <span data-scayt_word=Liguori data-scaytid=141>Liguori</span> as CEO of Tribune Media. During his five-year run, Tribune sold real estate property — including Chicago’s famed Tribune Tower — and, more recently, scrapped its planned digital news site Tribune.com weeks before its debut.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOqKytq5mZsrO%2FjJyYp5uVobKledOwpmarlZbAsLrSZpisZaecu26tzJ6popuRYr2tu9OsZKedp2Kxqr7EnKuip55ihnqAj3JwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
