On the one hand, there are those who were unimpressed with the spin-off, citing a multitude of issues. Granted, Big's death felt like a sizeable stab in the heart (the shot of the discarded Manolos was enough to make even the most insufferable <a class=hm-link href=#>Carrie</a> haters shed a tear), and the less said about the infamous Che Diaz the better, but in case you missed it, it certainly wasn't all bad.</p><p id=estAPa1myQWD data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 of Carrie Bradshaw's most stylish outfits and how to recreate them</a></strong></p><p id=eP7lzN70RvW5 data-wc=30>Looking at the show through a more favourable lens, still champions one of the key foundations on which Sex and the City was originally built: fashion.</p><p id=edMcwO1Xoy-J data-wc=60>While legendary costume designer Patricia Field is no longer involved, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago have been doing a stellar job at curating outfits for the beloved friendship circle as they navigate mid-life. Now that the filming for season two of the spin-off is now well under way, we can't help but get super excited about what's on the horizon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ec4fa4faff5-cynthia-nixon-and-sarah-jessica-parker-film-and-just-like-that-z.jpg><p id=epdF69kajMAH data-wc=71>New photos taken in New York on Wednesday showed <a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, alongside co-star Cynthia Nixon, wearing the most striking ensemble that epitomised 80s glam. Judging by the costumes being worn in the background – a Harry Potter, a hot dog suit, and a bloody surgeon were just a few that caught our attention – it appeared as though the pair were filming a Halloween episode. Spooky season stans?

Rocking a gilded polka dot pussy-bow dress and a metallic pink blazer (which boasted some pretty hefty shoulder pads), the star wouldn't have looked out of place alongside Dolly Parton in comedy film .&nbsp;</p><p id=eLvq0jzO2UlX data-wc=62>The concept of power dressing as a trend skyrocketed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as a means of allowing women to establish their authority in the workplace. Driven by the likes of Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren, it was all about exaggerated, boxy silhouettes that downplayed the female form, purporting to encourage the acceptance of women in the professional sphere.</p><p id=eELuK2Nd5n60 data-wc=20>Plus, Carrie's vintage copy of Cosmo?
