That wasn’t easy on them.” The distance was there despite Gomez's efforts to travel to several of the The Weeknd's shows in different cities in the United States and abroad. Though their romance is over, they're looking to remain friends. However, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new update from&nbsp;TMZ</a> has shed more light on this story that might change things slightly in that regard: apparently it was the Starboy who decided to end things.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As per the media outlet, several&nbsp;sources connected to both singer admit that their relationship had been on the rocks for several months.&nbsp;In addition to the infrequent in-person visits, the two had even been talking less and less on the phone. Abelm though, took it one step further and thought he was being unfairly tied down in a relationship that had clearly seen its spark&nbsp;diminish&nbsp;considerably. He allegedly rang Selena up a few weeks ago and let her know the relationship wasn't working for him before outright ending things. Again, the sources insist that both The Weeknd and Selena Gomez are staying friends and there has been no animosity festering between them. In fact, they've supposedly spoken several times since the breakup.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, there are still lingering rumors that The Weeknd's split from Selena had at least something to do with her <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Justin Bieber</a> reconnect. Not long ago, we&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">shared a post</a>&nbsp;on Selena and her ex-boyfriend, who were seen hanging out for the third time in quick succession.&nbsp;Restaurant outings, late-night house visits (over at hers) and still no admission that their romance is back on. The Weeknd, on the other hand, is clearly&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">back to enjoying being a single man</a> with a plan. What do you think? Is he better off without Gomez?
