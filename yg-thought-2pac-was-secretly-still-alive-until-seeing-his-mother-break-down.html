Despite the rapper being shot and killed in 1996, rumors persisted for decades that he had faked his death to escape the limelight of celebrity. One of those who believed this theory for a long time was <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YG</a>. Recently the rapper joined Theo Von on his podcast This Past Weekend. The pair discussed a number of things including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a>, who <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">caught a clip of the episode on Twitter</a>. Another subject they covered was that very same 2pac conspiracy theory. YG tells the story of how his mind was changed after meeting 2pac's mother.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“They wanted me to come speak on behalf of the new generation, like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>2Pac</a>’s impact on us,” he explained. “I said some sh*t and his mama came up to me and was like crying and sh*t. She was like, ‘I love what you said about my son.' I’m like, ‘Yeah, yeah, fa sho.’ And then she’s just looking at me and she crying and she’s like, ‘They really killed my baby! They really killed my baby!'” He elaborated on how the traumatic incident reshaped his takes on 2pac. "Bro, that sh*t f*cked me up ’cause I thought ‘Pac was alive. My whole life, bro, I thought ‘Pac was alive. But that day, I’m like, ‘Nah, bro, he gone.’ His mama was crying in my face. ‘Nah, he gone!’ Bro, that sh*t f*cked me up. That sh*t was crazy … It was sad as f*ck, bro."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZX1xgZNmsKBlpJ28trPHrWRrqJGYerit0maqraGcoXqiuMivnGagmaV6qbvPZqWer6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
