The elder Pfaff first came to prominence on Dyrdek's previous reality show project Rob & Big, on which he fell into the role of Dyrdek's hapless personal assistant who was often the butt of pranks or practical jokes. Since then, however, Pfaff has become a somewhat successful music producer who even has his own recording studio in the Fantasy Factory. And while Scott hasn't distinguished himself to the level of his older brother yet, he's managed to gain quite a following among fans of Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory as the show's resident skate technician. He has also filled the role his big brother had previously in many ways, often serving as the butt of jokes directed at his "awkwardness" in dealing with people, among other things. Scott Pfaff appeared on Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory from 2009 to 2015 and also appeared in episodes of the TV series Ridiculousness and Nitro Circus. In 2010 he appeared in TV documentary 1000 Ways to Die. Pfaff was a clip producer for the series Ridiculousness from 2011 to 2013. He is the owner of the Born a Lion clothing line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejmLy1wIyboKBlk5bBbrzFmp2fZZ6awW7DzquroWVibIN4gZc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
