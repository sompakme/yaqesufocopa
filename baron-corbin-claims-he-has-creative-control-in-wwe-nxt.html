While inconsistent booking plagued his tenure on the main roster, Corbin has since found a new home and creative freedom in NXT.</p><p>Following the WWE Draft, Corbin’s free-agent status left fans speculating about his future. In a surprising twist, <a href=#>Corbin made triumphant return to NXT in May</a>, promptly targeting Carmelo Hayes. Although his initial encounter with Hayes ended in defeat, Corbin has solidified himself as a reliable force within the NXT roster.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful</a>, Corbin unveiled a fascinating development. He disclosed that the legendary Shawn Michaels has granted him creative control over his character in NXT, allowing him to shape his wrestling persona.</p><p>Corbin expressed his trust in the WWE, highlighting his previous matchups with icons like Kurt Angle, John Cena, and The Rock as proof of their confidence in his abilities. He emphasized his commitment to delivering 110% in the ring.</p><p>Reflecting on his journey from free agency to NXT, Corbin revealed that WWE’s intent was to provide him flexibility while they determined the ideal storyline for his return. When the opportunity to join NXT arose, Corbin saw it as a chance to reinvent himself and explore new creative horizons.</p><p>He appreciated the proximity of NXT to his home, enabling him to perform on the show and return to the comfort of his own bed. Under the guidance of Shawn Michaels, Corbin embarked on a mission to redefine his character in a way that resonated with the NXT audience.</p><p>“I think that’s something I’ve always had as well. They put me in the ring with Kurt Angle. They put me in with Cena. They put me in with The Rock because they trust what I can do. They know whatever I do, it’s going to be 110%. So the free agent [status], same thing. I was like, ‘What is this? What does this mean? Am I out of a job? What are we doing?’ They were like, ‘No, we just don’t know what story we want to put you in yet, so we don’t want to pigeonhole you and have you on Raw or SmackDown. That was kind of the way it was originally told me. ‘We want you to be able to float because when we figure it out —’ because the character was coming off the JBL stuff, it wasn’t working, obviously. So it was like, ‘Okay, well, what are we doing?’ It kind of came up at Draft time, and they did that.”</p><p>“So then I was asked, ‘Hey, would you be interested in going to NXT and working?’ I said, ‘ Absolutely.’ It’s an hour and a half up the road from me. I’ll be able to go do the show, go home, and get my bed,” Corbin said. “So when they presented it to me, I just saw it as an opportunity. I didn’t know what the opportunity was, but when I went down there, Shawn [Michaels] is going, ‘Hey, what do you want this to be?’ I go, ‘Well, here’s what I would love to do. I would love to not be on Raw or SmackDown.’ Because I was also working at Cameron Grimes at the time on SmackDown, so I was doing NXT and SmackDown. I said, ‘I would love to just be here, and let’s redo my character. Let’s let me tell you what I think I am.’ He’s like, ‘I love that. Let’s do you. You have full control, essentially, on what you want to do, and they keep me in parameters, obviously, but they’re letting me just kind of reinvent myself as me, and I think we’re presenting a really cool thing to the fans in NXT.”</p><p>Corbin’s NXT stint may not be his final destination, as <a href=#>he remains open to the possibility of returning to the main roster</a> after his developmental journey. While he continues to thrive in NXT, the future holds unpredictable twists for this wrestling veteran. WWE fans eagerly anticipate the evolution of Baron Corbin’s character in the ever-dynamic world of professional wrestling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Baron Corbin said?
