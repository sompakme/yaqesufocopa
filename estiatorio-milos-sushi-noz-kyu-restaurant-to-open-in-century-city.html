I understand how to operate big buildings,” billionaire developer David Reuben Jr. says of his vision for the city.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">His firm is currently displaying their prowess with Century Plaza, the $2.5 billion, six-acre complex located alongside Avenue of the Stars in Century City. It is comprised of the luxury condo towers <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Park Elm at Century Plaza</a> (formerly Century Tower Residences), the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel, public parks, and 100,000 square feet of retail space.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Reuben knew they had an important gap to fill in Century City. “I live here, I work here, I want to be able to go to a cool restaurant at nighttime,” Reuben says. “The guys at JP Morgan want to take their clients somewhere that’s not Din Tai Fung. That’s no disrespect to Din Tai Fung. I happen to love soup dumplings, but if I had a million or a billion dollars in my fund, I’d probably want to take them somewhere a bit more high end.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">To fill that gap, Reuben has landed three acclaimed restaurants, all of which are slated to open their first-ever L.A. eateries at Century Plaza in late 2024. They include <a href=# rel=nofollow>estiatorio Milos</a>, chef Costas Spiliadis’s famed Greek seafood restaurant, which will debut its first L.A. location along Constellation Avenue directly across from Westfield Century City.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I am very excited to finally come to Los Angeles and be so close to the most beautiful products of California and the West Coast,” Spiliadis says. “This alone will bring Milos to another level. The simple, healthy, and straightforward Greek Cuisine could not find a better home away from the Greek Islands. The spectacular space at the Century Plaza will be transformed into a true temple for showcasing the best gifts of the land and the sea in which Californians and people of the world will experience the true food of the Mediterranean.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Chef-and-Restaurateur-Split-Century-Plaza-Publicity-H-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The fifth location of New York City celebrity hotspot <a href=# rel=nofollow>KYU</a>, the award-wining Asian-inspired concept spearheaded by chef Christopher Arellanes, will move in directly across from the Fairmont’s open-air lobby. The two are joined by the 2-Michelin-starred <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sushi Noz</a>, overseen by chef Nozomu Abe. “Century Plaza is going to become a landmark of fine dining in Los Angeles,” said David and Josh Foulquier, chef Noz’s business partners and co-founders of We All Gotta Eat Group, in a statement.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The addition of these restaurants is all part of the 360-degree approach the Reuben Brothers are taking as they transform Century Plaza — and they believe additions like KYU, estiatorio Milos, and Sushi Noz will make the residences at Park Elm at Century Plaza, which are listed from $2 million for an entry-level condo up to tens of millions for a penthouse — all the more desirable. (Pricing is not yet set for the seven penthouses, all of which will hit the market next year.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/New-Hero-Shadow-Version.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The restaurants join Lumière, the Fairmont Century Plaza hotel’s French-inspired American brasserie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“You walk down an elevator from your concierge, and you literally are in a parade of high-end retail and the best restaurants and then straight through it connects to Westfield,” says <a href=# id=auto-tag_real-estate_1 data-tag=real-estate>real estate</a> agent David Parnes of The Agency’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Bond Street Partners</a>. “You can’t literally get better than that — it literally doesn’t exist.” Parnes and his Bond Street co-founder James Harris, along with The Agency Development Group, are handling sales at the two towers. In April 2023, the Rebuen Brothers acquired control of Michael Rosenfeld’s Century Plaza development for $1 billion at a foreclosure auction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DBOX_CENTURY-PLAZA_Plaza_west_sunset.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The reimagination of Century City — home to business powerhouses including Bloomberg, JP Morgan, and CAA — into a walkable, mixed-use neighborhood of premium condos and walkable upscale commercial venues so far seems to be withstanding the downturn in the market. Newmark’s Kevin Shannon recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told The Real Deal</a> that Century City is “the best office market in the country.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The Century City office market is booming. It’s bucking the trend of the office market in general,” Parnes says. “It’s really the urban core for offices led by the entertainment industry and a lot of celebrities are moving to Century City as well.”&nbsp;To wit, Rihanna purchased a condo (once owned by Matthew Perry) at the adjacent The Century building last year for $21 million, while Priscilla Presley reportedly bought a condo in Century City in 2021 for $4.8 million.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Reuben’s goal —&nbsp;finally fulfilling Century City’s original promise — seems well under way. “What Century Plaza has done is brought the dream of what Century City was always supposed to be 1950s to 1960s to what it is now,” he says. “And it was always supposed to be the greatest city within a city.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Scroll further for photos of Park Elm at Century Plaza:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/211-Elm-Ct_FullRes23_-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/211-Elm-Ct_FullRes24_-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/211-Elm-Ct_FullRes01_.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeVqMGqrdOoqaKnXaK2rbvSZqquq5ieeq%2B72Waisq1dp7K0wMCuqZqmpKh6pLHNrayrsV2YtrXFjGppbG1nZX9zhJVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
