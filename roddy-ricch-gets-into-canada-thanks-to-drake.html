As much as race plays a factor in it, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G-Eazy</a> has also been denied at the border so there seems to inexplicable targetting towards rappers in general, as well. Anyways, Roddy Ricch has finally made it into Canada and it appears that he has <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> to thank for that. Drake's the plug and all it took was one phone call for Roddy to get into the country.
