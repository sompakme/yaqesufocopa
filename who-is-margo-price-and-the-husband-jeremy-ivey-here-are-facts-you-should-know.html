She has also received several awards, including a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist.&nbsp;There’s no doubt that she’s taking the country music scene by storm.&nbsp;The following are the facts you need to know about her and her husband Jeremy Ivey.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio (Age) – Who is Margo Price?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Margo Rae Price was born on April 15, 1983 in Aledo, a small farming town in the state of Illinois.&nbsp;As a child, she obviously had musical talent.&nbsp;She sang at her local church and also played several instruments.&nbsp;The singer spent her formative years in Aledo, completing her elementary and high school education.</span></p><p><span>After completing her high school education, Price received a cheerleading scholarship to Northern Illinois University (NIC).&nbsp;She briefly studied Communications at NIC before switching her major to Dance, Theater and Spanish.&nbsp;Despite the change of majors, Price remained unfulfilled.&nbsp;Her true love, music, still called to her.</span></p><p><span>So she dropped out of school in 2003 and moved to Nashville to pursue her career.&nbsp;In Nashville, Margo Price sang in various clubs and bars.&nbsp;She also took odd jobs (as a waitress and dance teacher) to supplement her income.&nbsp;She then met husband Jeremy Ivey.&nbsp;Together they formed a band called Secret Handshake.&nbsp;They later added more members and the band morphed into a rock band called Buffalo Clover.&nbsp;Buffalo Clover achieved minimal success and later disbanded.</span></p><span>In 2015/2016, Price (along with her husband)took a gamble.&nbsp;They decided to sell their few possessions to buy studio time.&nbsp;The time was used to record Price’s debut album, Midwest Farmer’s Daughter.&nbsp;The album was recorded in just three days at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee.&nbsp;She sent the album to several record labels but was turned down.&nbsp;The album was eventually recorded by Third Man Records and released on March 25, 2016.</span><p><span>It shot to the top of the Billboard Country Music Albums chart.&nbsp;It was also widely praised, with Vulture calling Price “one of the most compelling voices out of Nashville in recent memory”.&nbsp;Since that success, Margo Price has released a second album,&nbsp;</span><span>All American Made</span><span>&nbsp;(2017).&nbsp;She has also appeared on several shows in the US and UK.&nbsp;She has also received several awards, including Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2016 Americana Music Awards and Song of the Year at the 2018 Americana Music Awards.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Her husband – Jeremy Ivey</span></strong></h2><p><span>Margo Price is long-married to her collaborator and partner Jeremy Ivey.&nbsp;They married in 2008 in White Creek, Tennessee.&nbsp;Jeremy is also a musician, guitarist and Price’s success story cannot be complete without mentioning her husband’s name.&nbsp;He was an integral part of her journey to stardom.&nbsp;He believed in her talent so much that he pawned her most prized possessions (including Price’s wedding ring) just so they could buy studio time.</span></p><p><span>That big gamble eventually paid off and Price became a successful solo artist.&nbsp;On the other hand, her husband bought back the pledged wedding ring and returned it.&nbsp;Price and her husband still work together professionally.&nbsp;He brings lyrics and instrumentals to their albums.</span></p><h2><strong><span>their children and their family life</span></strong></h2><p><span>The couple have one child together, a son named Judah was born in 2010.&nbsp;They even had twin sons in 2010, but one of them, Ezra, died of heart disease after just two weeks.&nbsp;His death plunged Price into a depression.&nbsp;She took alcohol to deal with her pain.&nbsp;However, with her husband’s help, she became sober.&nbsp;Price and her husband will welcome another child in 2019.</span></p><p><span>Margo Price’s mother was a teacher, father was a farmer/farm owner.&nbsp;Her father later became a prison guard after they lost their farm to the banks.&nbsp;Price also has a few sisters, but their names are not yet available.&nbsp;There is no doubt that her family background influenced her music.&nbsp;She sings about issues such as the economic struggles of low-income families.</span></p><p><span>In addition, Price is related to well-known country songwriter Bob Fischer.&nbsp;Fischer is her great-uncle and has written for legendary country singers such as Reba McEntire and George Jones.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMppirn59ivbO1wp5kmqaUYsGpsYyhrKyakaOxbrbEq5ymsV2ew6bFjKGcq51dlr%2BmecWamq2rXa68tnnSoaaupJRiuK%2B71mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
