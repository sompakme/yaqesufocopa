Some poems contain a Grimm’s-fairy-tale-type element, and others serve the same purpose as memes in online culture. All of it is something women can relate to.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fox (who voices a character in the latest Mortal Kombat video game) gave fans a preview of the poem, “Why I Have Insomnia,” on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyo5rY3stCK/>Instagram</a>, revealing the lines, “And my heart never rests / because it does not trust / the hand that holds it” alongside an animation illustrated by Japanese-American artist Audrey Kawasaki.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“All of my healers tell me that my throat chakra is blocked,” the new author begins in her book’s intro. “In case you aren’t familiar, the throat chakra is the energy center that is related to communication … My problem is that I deeply identify my feelings and have multitudinous ways of articulating them, but I am not able to express them because when I do it has made the men who have loved me feel intimidated, inadequate and insecure. And so I have spent all of my life making myself so small so that others can feel confident. I have a savior/martyr complex.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She continues, “This book is for anyone who has given much more than they received, or for anyone who struggles to believe they deserve to be heard. This book is also for me. Because fuck. I deserve better.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fox explains on the back cover: “These poems were written in an attempt to excise the illness that had taken root in me because of my silence. I’ve spent my entire life keeping the secrets of men, my body aches from carrying the weight of their sins. My freedom lives in these pages, and I hope that my words can inspire others to take back their happiness and their identity by using their voice to illuminate what’s been buried, but not forgotten, in the darkness.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible’s Extended Fall Prime Day Deal Saves You 60 Percent Off a Monthly Subscription</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Those who want to listen to Fox’s Pretty Boys Are Poisonous for free can do so with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>a 30-day trial</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Audible</a>, which includes one free credit each month to use on any premium title to keep forever and access to best-selling audiobooks, new releases, podcasts, original content and more.
