itemprop=articleBody><p><span>There’s no doubt that UFC fans will be familiar with Dustin Poirier.&nbsp;The American mixed martial artist is one of the stars of the fight organization and is also among the top fighters in the official UFC lightweight rankings.</span></p><p><span>A lethal fighter who was raised in the MMA system, Dustin Poirier is a complete fighter.&nbsp;His tendency to use power punches like the backhand and use headbutts and tips to set up more powerful strikes like a cross makes him a formidable opponent.&nbsp;For more, here’s everything you need to know about the UFC star.</span></p><h3><strong><span>the biography</span></strong></h3><p><span>Dustin Glenn Poirier was born on November 19, 1989 in Lafayette, Louisiana.&nbsp;As a fighter, he got his start in high school when he wrestled at Northside High School.&nbsp;In 2009, he turned pro and went on to amass a 7-0 record, mostly competing in regional promotions in his native Louisiana and the southern United States.</span></p><p><span>Like many of his UFC peers, Dustin Poirier’s road to the UFC began with World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC).&nbsp;After the WEC merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship in October 2010, all WEC fighters transferred to the UFC.&nbsp;In his first fight under a new regime, Dustin won his fight against number 1 contender Josh Grispi at UFC 125 and was won by unanimous decision.</span></p><p><span>Dustin Poirier’s UFC career continued on a steady rise in 2011, winning both of his fights that year.&nbsp;One by unanimous decision and the other by a runoff, D’arce chokes.&nbsp;In 2012, Dustin’s steadily progressing career earned him a fight for the main event at UFC on Fuel after previously defeating Max Holloway in the first round of a fight with an A-arm in the mount position.&nbsp;In his main event, Dustin was defeated by Chan Sung Jung by submitting in the fourth round.&nbsp;The performances of both fighters, however, earned them Fight of the Night honors.&nbsp;At the end of 2012, the fight was considered the fight of the year by several publications.&nbsp;In his last fight in 2012, Dustin defeated Jonathan Brookins by submission, ending 2012 with a 2-1 record.</span></p><p><span>Despite his fight just 63 days prior, Dustin Poirier returned to action and took on Cub Swanson in a fight.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Louisana native ultimately lost the fight via unanimous decision.</span></p><p><span>Dustin earned his second bonus Fight of the Night award in 2014, defeating Akira Corassani at the Ultimate Fighter Nations Finals.&nbsp;He won the fight via TKO in the second round.&nbsp;On September 27, 2014, the young fighter had one of the highest scoring fights of his career against Conor McGregor.&nbsp;He lost the fight in the first round by TKO, a result he attributed to getting caught up in the arrogance of the Conor brand.&nbsp;After the loss, Dustin made some career evaluations and decided to fight only in the Lightweight division.</span></p><p><span>In 2018, after 28 fights with 22 wins and his third Fight of the Night title, he signed a new contract with the UFC despite having three fights in his previous contracts.&nbsp;His next two fights after his new contract ended in victory for Dustin.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Woman and child</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dustin Poirier is a happily married and devoted father.&nbsp;His wife Jolie became pregnant at the end of 2015 and on August 20, 2016, the couple had their first child, Parker Noelle Poirier.&nbsp;Although originally from Lafayette, Louisiana, Dustin and his family moved to South Florida for training purposes.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight and body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>To be a successful fighter within the UFC, one must be at the peak of their physical health;&nbsp;Dustin Poirier is therefore in great shape.&nbsp;The fighter has his height listed at 5ft 9in while his weight is recorded at 155lbs (70kg).&nbsp;Further details of his body measurements are currently unknown.</span></p><p><span>It’s easy for him to get in shape, considering he has to keep training and training if he wants to keep his momentum going.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Dustin Poirier – Net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>A formidable fighter and one on the cusp of the UFC payroll for a long time, Dustin is making big money with his winning streak.&nbsp;The American fighter is currently estimated at $1.6 million.&nbsp;If he continues his winning streak, that number will grow much faster in the near future.</span></p><p class=postsid
