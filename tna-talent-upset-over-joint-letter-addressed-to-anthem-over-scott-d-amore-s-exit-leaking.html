The letter expressed views that many fans agreed with as well.</p><p>According to Sean Ross Sapp on the Fightful Select Backstage Q&A Podcast, it was noted that individuals were upset upon learning that the letter had been leaked. Others remarked that the letter did not reflect a collaborative effort and, therefore, did not represent the views of everyone involved.</p><p>It was clarified that the intention was never to speak for the entire group but rather to convey the sentiments of several TNA talents, who were all loyal to Scott D’Amore.</p><p>”There were some unhappy that the letter got out. There were some that said, “well this wasn’t a collaborative effort, so it didn’t represent all of us.” Which it was never said to represent everybody. It represented several TNA talents. But was actually sent and there are a lot of people loyal to Scott.”</p><p>Scott D’Amore’s&nbsp;<a href=#>TNA firing was also in the works long before it was officially announced</a>. Another departure also <a href=#>took place right after Scott D’Amore’s firing</a>.
