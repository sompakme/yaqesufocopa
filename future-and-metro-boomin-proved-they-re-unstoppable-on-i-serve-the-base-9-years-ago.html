The pair teamed up repeatedly across the rapper's critical darling 2015 album DS2. Tracks like "Where Ya At," "Stick Talk," and opener "Thought It Was A Drought" have all become well known additions to the rapper's discography. But among die hard fans DS2 is packed full of beloved deep cuts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of those is "I Serve The Base" which comes second on the album and keeps the high-intensity demeanor. Future and Metro are the only two credited writers on the song with Metro serving as the lone producer. Though that they absolutely hold nothing back making a loud, brash, and hard-hitting cut. In the near decade since it was released the song has racked up millions of plays from fans of both artists. That adds up to just under 100 million streams on Spotify and more than 15 million views on YouTube. Take a trip back in time for throwback Thursday and hear the song once again below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-future-and-metro-boomin-s-rager-i-served-the-base>Future And Metro Boomin's Rager "I Served The Base"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Future and Metro Boomin's "I Serve The Base?"
