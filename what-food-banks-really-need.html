Between 1 April and 30 September this year, a staggering <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/mid-year-stats/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1.5 million food parcels were given to people in crisis" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">1.5 million food parcels were given to people in crisis</a>, a 16 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2022. Nearly half a million went to children, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.trusselltrust.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Trussell Trust" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Trussell Trust</a>, an 11 per cent rise compared to last year. The foundation, which runs a network of nationwide food banks, said this is just a fraction of the total food aid handed out in the UK by thousands of other charities, schools and councils.<strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The majority of those who are forced to visit food banks do so as a result of low income, caused by social security, debt, health conditions, challenging life experiences and/or ill-health. Issues with social security payments such as delays or sanctions also prompt many to resort to emergency food parcels. One in seven people living in the UK now face hunger due to lack of money. The Trussell Trust is bracing itself for its busiest winter yet, with more than 600,000 people expected to need support. The organisation predicts it will need to provide more than one million emergency food parcels from December to February.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Changes to welfare and the cost of living crisis bear down hardest on those who are least able to bear it. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.foodaidnetwork.org.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent Food Aid Network" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Independent Food Aid Network</a>'s Sabine Goodwin <strong></strong>called for the government to increase benefits to rise with inflation to prevent thousands being pushed into poverty. “The food banks in our network are reporting unprecedented demand and increasing concerns about their capacity to cope both physically and mentally. A ‘sticking plaster’ food parcel can only ever temporarily alleviate the problem of poverty and Trussell Trust food banks represent the very tip of the UK’s food insecurity iceberg.”</p><img alt="uk poverty foodbank" title="UK - Poverty - Foodbank" width=4724 height=3150 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/trussell-trust-food-bank-box-for-a-family-with-three-news-photo-1703165149.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Andrew Aitchison</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is no question that those who visit food banks are in real and urgent need. Some are victims of domestic abuse, others are refugees and there are those who are employed, but their income is still not enough to feed their families. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn07096/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="One in five people in the UK" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">One in five people in the UK</a> live below the poverty line; they need food, hygiene products and products to clean their clothes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.trusselltrust.org/make-a-donation/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="MAKE A DONATION HERE" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">MAKE A DONATION HERE</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Food banks are different to soup kitchens, which typically serve hot food for free. Both cater to the homeless, but – rather than giving food to be eaten there and then – food banks offer three days' worth of supplies to make meals at home. In case of the homeless, parcels feature items that can be eaten cold or as they are, or products where only hot water is needed, as this can be obtained in local cafes or shelters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Food banks across the UK provide food to those in crisis who are struggling to feed themselves and their families," says Elizabeth Maytom, project lead for the Norwood and Brixton Food Bank. "It is the hope that through campaigning about issues and helping the wider community to understand about poverty, that there will be a time that food banks do not exist – but this year and in the coming months as we head in 2024, your local food bank would appreciate your support. Do get in touch with the food bank nearest to you to find out about their shortages to avoid overstocking and waste."</p><img alt="wandsworth food bank prepares and distributes parcels for the weekend" title="Wandsworth Food Bank Prepares And Distributes Parcels For The Weekend" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/volunteers-at-wandsworth-foodbank-prepare-parcels-for-news-photo-1703165251.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Leon Neal</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you want to help, then you can either donate or volunteer. While it's understandable to reach towards the baked beans or pasta, there are a few items in short supply that might not immediately spring to mind. Non-food items, such as shower gel and washing powder, are not in as high supply, but are crucial in helping people in crisis to retain their dignity. Many new parents are struggling to buy essential items for their babies, so consider donating nappies, wet wipes and baby food.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you are thinking of making a donation to your local food bank (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="find out which branch is nearest here" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">find out which branch is nearest here</a>), then consider the following:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Items to donate</strong></p><ul data-node-id=14 class="css-1r2vahp emevuu60"><li>Toothbrushes</li><li>Washing up liquid</li><li>Cleaning products</li><li>Bars of soap</li><li>Deodorant</li><li>Shampoo</li><li>Toilet rolls</li><li>Tinned vegetables</li><li>Tinned meat</li><li>Tinned fruit</li><li>Whole and semi-skimmed UHT milk</li><li>Tea/coffee</li><li>Cereal or porridge oats</li><li>Soup</li><li>Pasta sauce</li><li>Microwave rice</li><li>Lentils, beans and pulses</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Items not to donate</strong></p><ul data-node-id=16 class="css-1r2vahp emevuu60"><li>Anything with a short self-life (e.g. fresh cakes, bread or baked goods)</li><li>Anything that requires refrigeration (e.g. fresh fish)</li><li>Anything frozen</li><li>Anything containing alcohol (including chocolate liqueurs)</li><li>Anything already opened</li><li>Anything out of date</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Donations can be distributed in three ways – directly to your local food bank, at collection points in supermarkets across the country, or by hosting a collection at your school, church or business for your local food bank.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over 90 per cent of donations to food banks are from the public.
