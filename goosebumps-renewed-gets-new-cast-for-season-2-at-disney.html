Stine’s beloved book series for a second season — with a twist: it will be turned into an anthology series. The sophomore season will feature an entirely new story, cast and setting. The show’s creative team, including showrunner Hilary Winston (Community), will return.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Disney+ says season two will revolve around “teenage siblings who discover a threat within their home, setting off a chain of events that unravel a profound mystery. As they delve into the unknown, the duo finds themselves entangled in the story of five teenagers who mysteriously vanished in 1994.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Season one featured a cast led by Justin Long, Rachael Harris and Zack Morris and has a 74 percent score among critics and 69 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Exec producers are Nicholas Stoller (The Muppets), Rob Letterman (Pokémon: Detective Pikachu), who developed the series, Winston, Neal H. Moritz, Scholastic Entertainment’s Iole Lucchese, Pavun Shetty, Conor Welch, Scholastic Entertainment’s Caitlin Friedman and Erin O’Malley.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Audiences everywhere fell in love with the series’ chills, thrills, heart and humor, making it one of <a href=# id=auto-tag_disney-branded-television data-tag=disney-branded-television>Disney Branded Television</a>’s most-watched shows of last year,” said <a href=# id=auto-tag_ayo-davis data-tag=ayo-davis>Ayo Davis</a>, president, Disney Branded Television. “We can’t wait to dive deeper into the brilliant mind of R.L. Stine, and to collaborate once again with Sony Pictures Television, Scholastic Entertainment, and our fantastic creative team to bring an entirely new mystery to Disney+ for season two.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The series is produced by Sony Pictures Entertainment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We are incredibly proud of the work of our writers, producers, cast and crew and the vision they brought to season one, which a new generation of fans are loving alongside those who grew up in R.L. Stine’s iconic world,” says Katherine Pope, president of Sony Pictures Television Studios. “Like when you cracked open a new book in the Goosebumps series, we can’t wait to see how the writers flip the show on its head as we explore the series as an anthology. Thanks to Disney Branded Television, who remain steadfast partners throughout this wonderfully chilling journey.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Davis’ Disney Branded Television continues its hot streak with the Goosebumps renewal joining Percy Jackson at the Mouse House division. That series also scored a <a href=#>season two pickup</a> this week.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">News of the Goosebumps renewal was announced Saturday at Disney Branded Television’s presentation at the Television Critics Association’s winter press tour, where Davis also announced an overall deal with Chris and Shane Houghton, the creators of Disney Channel’s Big City Greens. The siblings will create and develop animated and live-action projects for both Disney’s animation unit as well as Davis’ studio. Big City Greens has run for four seasons and nearly 100 episodes and ranked as the second most-watched kids show in 2023. As part of the pact, the duo will expand the Big City Greens franchise to a movie, which will debut in the summer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Davis also revealed that there will be a fourth film in the Zombies franchise with Milo Manheim and Meg Donnelly starring and exec producing. Superkitties and Pupstruction were also both renewed for their third seasons on Disney Junior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoKaoq5WXwq680maYp6yYpLmws9hmqZ6mlayypXnSnpisp55if26wyKylnrFdZn90gZdraG5vaGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
