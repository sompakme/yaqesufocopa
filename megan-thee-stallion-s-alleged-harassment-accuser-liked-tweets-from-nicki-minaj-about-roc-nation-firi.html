He claims that the “harassment was so severe or pervasive” that it created a “hostile, abusive work environment” and made “working conditions intolerable.” In turn, he wants compensation. His attorney, Ron Zambrano, further told&nbsp;NBC News&nbsp;in a statement: “Megan just needs to pay our client what he’s due, own up to her behavior and quit this sort of sexual harassment and fat shaming conduct. Emilio should never have been put in a position of having to be in the vehicle with her while she had sex with another woman. ‘Inappropriate’ is putting it lightly. Exposing this behavior to employees is definitely illegal.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fans-uncover-posts-emilio-garcia-liked>Fans Uncover Posts Emilio Garcia Liked</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
