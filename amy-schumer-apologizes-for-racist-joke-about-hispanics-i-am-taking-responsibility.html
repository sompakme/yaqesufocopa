I played a dumb white girl onstage. I still do sometimes. Once I realized I had more eyes and ears on me and had an influence I stopped telling jokes like that onstage.”</p><p>“I am evolving as an artist,” she added. “I am taking responsibility and hope I haven’t hurt anyone.

And that’s OK.”</p><p>She referred to the same shtick of playing an “irreverent idiot” that makes “dumb jokes involving race.”</p><p>“I enjoy playing the girl who time to time says the dumbest thing possible, and playing with race is a thing we are not supposed to do, which is what makes it so fun for comics,” she said.</p><p>The Guardian pointed to her consensual Hispanic joke, as well as a joke she made about “crazy” Latina women while hosting the MTV Movie Awards in April.</p><p>“You can call it a ‘blind spot for racism’ or ‘lazy,’ but you are wrong,” said <span data-scayt_word=Schumer data-scaytid=18>Schumer</span>. “It is a joke and it is funny.
