Daniel had challenged Vasco, a former gang leader and a friend, to a fight to test his strength and resolve. Vasco had accepted the challenge, despite knowing that Daniel was hiding something. The fight was intense and brutal, with both sides showing their skills and determination. However, Daniel had an advantage: he could switch between his two bodies, and use the best of both. He managed to defeat Vasco, but not without paying a price. He suffered severe injuries, and his secret was exposed to Vasco and the others.</p><p>Vasco was shocked and angry to learn that Daniel had been lying to him and everyone else. He felt betrayed and hurt by his friend, who had used him as a stepping stone. He confronted Daniel, who tried to explain his situation and apologize. However, Vasco was not in the mood to listen. He punched Daniel in the face, knocking him out. He then left the scene, along with the other spectators, leaving Daniel alone and unconscious.</p><p>Meanwhile, we also see the perspective of Jay, another main character and a friend of Daniel. Jay is a famous rapper and a former gang member, who had been involved in a scandal with a female idol. He had been framed by his former boss, Gun, who wanted to ruin his career and reputation. Jay had been hiding from the public and the media, trying to clear his name and expose Gun’s schemes. He had also been looking for Daniel, who had gone missing after the fight with Vasco. He finally found Daniel’s location, thanks to a tip from Zack, another friend of Daniel. He rushed to the scene, hoping to find Daniel and help him.</p><p>However, he arrived too late. He saw Daniel lying on the ground, covered in blood and bruises. He was shocked and worried, wondering what had happened to him. He tried to wake him up, but there was no response. He then noticed that Daniel’s body was changing. He saw his face and body morphing from his handsome, fit appearance to his original, overweight appearance. He realized that Daniel had a secret, and that he was not who he seemed to be. He was stunned and confused, not knowing what to make of it. The chapter ended with a cliffhanger, leaving the readers in suspense and anticipation for the next chapter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Release_Date_of_Lookism_Chapter_480></span><strong>Release Date of Lookism Chapter 480</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The release date for Lookism Chapter 480 is<strong> December 21, 2023</strong>.
