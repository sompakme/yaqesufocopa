Tip recently began the rollout for his forthcoming project, <a href=# rel>Kill The King</a>, which will mark the end of his era in rap. Though it’s unclear if he’ll commit to comedy full-time, the “Whatever You Like” rapper plans to dethrone himself as the self-proclaimed “King Of The South” – a title he’s carried for the last two decades.</p><p>While T.I. dished out a few singles over the past year, he began teasing a collaboration with Kevin Gates in 2022. The song leaked online after Tip began teasing the record on Instagram, though it seemed like the unofficial version terminated the possibilities of an official release. However, earlier this week, T.I. began to tease the single with Kevin Gates again, as fans anticipated two Southern giants connecting on wax for a commanding street banger.</p><span><h2 id=h-t-i-flexes-hard-on-active-ft-kevin-gates>T.I. Flexes Hard On "Active" Ft. Kevin Gates</h2></span><p>This morning, T.I. unveiled the single with Kevin Gates in full.&nbsp; Javar Rockamore of The Loopholes delivers a menacing production with ghostly synths sweeping through the enchanting guitar strings. Tip and Gates evidently bring out the best in each other throughout the record as they both reflect on the spiritual crossroads. Gates opens his verse with a passage from the Qu’ran before spilling an emotionally potent verse that details the intersection between his spirituality and his street deeds.</p><p>Though Gates holds down both the hook and his verse, the record intends to showcase their lyrical swords. T.I. similarly opens up his verse with a passage from Psalm 91 before bearing his soul in one of his most impressive verses in a while. Tip looks back at the hardships he’s faced throughout his life, from the streets to rap, detailing how he overcame adversity to prosper. Hopefully, a release date for Kill The King arrives shortly.
