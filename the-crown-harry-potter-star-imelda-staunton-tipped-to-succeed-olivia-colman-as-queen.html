Claire Foy played a young Elizabeth in the first two seasons.</p><p>However, Netfix has denied the report. The company told Deadline: "We are currently filming season four of The Crown but have not commissioned any further seasons yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Oscar-nominated Staunton, 63, has had a long career on screen and on stage.<br>She's best known for Vera Drake, in which she played the title character, and roles in Maleficent and the recent Downton Abbey movie.</p><p>But for one generation, Staunton is best known as sadistic teacher Dolores Umbridge in the Harry Potter franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/r8uPr68I70XJFG9IDwqPtih23YI=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/DBSIQSXJ3FS45ITBSZFIUIZUS4.jpg"><p>The Crown debuted on Netflix in 2016 to wide acclaim. The series follows the tribulations of the British royal family from the time of Queen Elizabeth's marriage to Prince Philip. The current third season takes place from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s.</p><p>Season four will introduce Princess Diana as a character. She will be played by relative unknown lookalike Emma Corrin.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The fourth season is expected to take the show till the mid-1980s. Because no casting news has been announced on Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, it's possible it will stop before Fergie married Prince Andrew in the late 1980s.</p><p>Potential fifth and sixth seasons will likely feature the divorces of Charles and Diana, Andrew and Fergie, the burning of Windsor Castle and the death of Diana.</p><p>The Crown creator Peter Morgan has previously penned The Queen, starring Helen Mirren, which told the story of Diana's death in 1997 and the public uproar over the Queen's taciturn response.</p><p>Morgan has signed an overall deal to develop TV series and movies for Netflix.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-royalty">Related articles</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMnKmor55itaK%2B0bJkqaekqbKzedKtmKtlmaKyrbDAZqqtmaWjwbC6jK2gqaiVmXq1u4ysrJyblZqxbrvLoq2imV2YvK25wKdkmqtdpsKmsc1obnxufIGQjJqjjIp7hGOMnneTrIaLfm99ho5w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
