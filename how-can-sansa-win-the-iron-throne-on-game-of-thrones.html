Daenerys Targaryen is going head-to-head with the current incumbent, Cersei Lannister, but both queens are mad in their own right; Daenerys is literally the daughter of the Mad King (and will definitely be&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a27206091/daenerys-targaryen-mad-queen-game-of-thrones-theory/>setting some people on fire&nbsp;</a>very, very soon), and Cersei is a pathological liar in a turnip wig with zero qualms about killing innocent people.</p><p>Rumored but unconfirmed to officially be playing the&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;(so that's how this show got its name) is the former Warden of the North, Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen. Jon is a strong leader with significant experience on the battlefield, and people&nbsp;really&nbsp;want him to be the next king of Westeros, but he truly does not want the job. And for good reason—there'd be too many people trying to kill him for the crown, and Jon would have to break off his already troubled relationship with Daenerys. All this man wants is to lay up with his auntie in peace. Why won't y'all leave him alone?</p><p>So, if not Daenerys, Cersei, or Jon, who else could rule the Seven Kingdoms?</p><p>Sansa.</p><p>Sansa Stark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjQXWxZjnpuH7Bk7zuThC7-1920-80.jpg><p>Does she have a rightful claim to the throne? No, not at all. As Targaryens, Jon and Daenerys have the strongest *technical* claims to the Iron Throne, and Cersei is just sitting there because who's really going to check her? Fortunately, Sansa doesn't need to be in line for the throne in order to take it because she's got something that so few people in Westeros have: sense.</p><p>One would think that common sense wouldn't be so difficult to find in the Seven Realms, but here we are! A combination of shockingly poor battle strategy and gross underestimation of the enemy brings us to our current situation in&nbsp;Game of Thrones.

Neither Jon or Daenerys have spent any real time with Cersei and, as a result, have no idea of what she's capable of. Sansa, on the other hand, was (un)fortunate enough to have had a front row seat to Cersei's schemes. She's seen how Cersei manipulates those around her, and she's seen the depths of Cersei's cruelty—Sansa knows that the crooked queen is nothing to play with. If anyone knows how to usurp the throne, it's the Lady of the North.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RLcDcvXS9m2JAY4tefyevG-1920-80.jpg><p>In addition to having high-level reconnaissance on Cersei, Sansa is also a very practical person. Both Jon and Daenerys lack the crucial ability to be pragmatic; Jon thinks that the North will follow Daenerys even if his true identity is revealed, and Daenerys truly believes that she can take Cersei down with one dragon and a dozen Unsullied soldiers. The delusion jumped out!</p><p>Meanwhile, Sansa is able to pay attention to how the minor details affect the big picture. She's the only person in Winterfell concerned about the well-being of the soldiers, thinking about what they're going to eat or whether they're in the proper head space to immediately travel all the way to King's Landing after watching their comrades be slaughtered by the Night King's army. Does Daenerys care about the emotional and mental state of her employees? Oh? I didn't think so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ry58yLf6nnJz92sChN3sxZ-1920-80.jpg><p>Sansa is likely to be one of the few big players in Westeros to actually survive the coming episodes.

It's not looking good. Arya is currently headed straight for King's Landing to cross Cersei's name off her kill list, but Jaime might beat her to it if the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a27192376/cersei-valonqar-game-of-thrones-theory/>valonqar</a>&nbsp;theory holds any weight.

In all of the wild speculations we've made so far, Sansa has been one of the only names to not be in any imminent danger.</p><p>I think this little bird is going to make it all the way.</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://link.marieclaire.com/join/3oa/mar-newsletter?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>SUBSCRIBE HERE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGtvY2WEdICVaKqapqOWerTAwKuiZq%2BZo7umvoyiqaimXam1s7vNnmSgmZ2aerCyjK2fq6eemsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
