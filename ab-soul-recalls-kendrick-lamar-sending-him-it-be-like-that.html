He says that the two are closer than people may expect.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Kendrick sent that to me, just to let you guys know how close me and him are. He sends me records sometimes that he feels I should try,” Soul further said. “It was an exercise. I said on this one, I don’t want no punchlines, no metaphors, no double entendres, I want to be simple as possible, straight to the point. It was probably the most difficult song for me to write on the album and it’s the most simplistic song.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The two spent years together on TDE, before Lamar's recent departure.
