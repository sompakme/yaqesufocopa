Mary and Richard had only been married six weeks when she discovered she was pregnant, aged just 18. Richie was born on 3 July, 1956 – but when the little boy was five-years-old, his parents divorced, with Mary going on to marry <strong>Grant Tinker</strong> six months later.

By the time Richie was five, I had already let him down. When he needed me the most, I was busier and more self-concerned than I had been when he was an impressionable infant."</p><p id=ey6GzshpHLZ2><a class=hm-link href=#>Stars pay tribute to Mary Tyler Moore</a></p><p id=eIu5rWD6Vnll data-wc=63>The relationship between mother and son soon became strained, and in 1971, Richie moved to California with his father. According to <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a></strong>, Richie thrived while living with his dad and when Richard was moved out of town for work, he persuaded his parents to let his remain in Fresno on his own to complete school.
