By the end of the day, approximately 200 Muscogee people had been killed.</p><p dir=ltr>As described at the time&nbsp;in the <a href=#>Columbian Phenix</a> by General John Coffee, who led the attack, they had orders to destroy the Muscogee village completely. Coffee described a fierce battle, in which the Muscogee fought fearlessly to protect their homes and families, but were ultimately overwhelmed by the massive number of attackers. As noted by <a href=#>Slate</a>, the soldiers killed all the men who had lived in the village and set houses on fire. One of the soldiers was&nbsp;frontiersman <a href=#>Davy Crockett</a>, who would later briefly describe the massacre, saying only, "We shot them like dogs."</p><p dir=ltr>Many children were orphaned in the attack. As described by the <a href=#>National Parks Service</a>, one of the survivors was an infant boy, still holding onto his mother's body. This baby would soon attract the attention of Andrew Jackson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkXBwcWtfocavr86ymGasmJp6tb7AoKCcZaOpvLPFjKidZpmemb%2Bmw4yjmJyjo6S7tHnAnaaprJWZeqS%2BxJ6iZqufo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
