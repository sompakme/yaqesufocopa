Rodman wasn't just talented; he revolutionized the forward position, proving you didn't have to be a 7-footer to play like one. In fact, the 6-foot-8 Rodman out-hustled taller men night in and night out. He "terrorized teams," <a href=#>per Sports Illustrated</a>, and even when opponents double-teamed him he still might grab 34 rebounds in a game.</p><p>Nicknamed the "Worm," Rodman had a slim frame and frenetic, almost wriggly defensive style that made him a useful weapon against Michael Jordan. Somewhat mislabeled as a "back-up Jordan-stopper" <a href=#>by Sports Illustrated</a> (Jordan was unstoppa-Bull), Rodman was Detroit's reliable second option behind Joe Dumars for defending against arguably the greatest NBA player who ever lived. Not too shabby.</p><p>Rodman left Detroit with two championship rings and roughly 20 bajillion rebounds. He later went to Chicago and grabbed three more titles. A fan of the spotlight, he became a bestselling author, dyed his hair every color in the crayon box, and starred in hilariously bad <a href=#>movies</a> like Double Team, and that's only the tip of his post-Pistons iceberg. Rodman was also married to Carmen Electra for a few months, had <a href=#>a pro-wrestling feud</a> with Karl Malone, a real-life feud with the law, an ill-fated romance with <a href=#>Madonna</a>, an ill-conceived bromance with North Korea's dictator, and got involved with the cryptocurrency PotCoin. What hasn't he done?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2lrb2tfrLWiwIytn55llJrBs7vIrWSpoaOpvK%2B%2FjJuYnWWSpMa0ecuopqRlnJ64pnnNqK5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
