Simple and universal (at least for those with manes long enough to be swept into a high-slung style), the high pony is polished, pretty, playful, and easily personalized with your favorite accessories. Plus, the updo comes with some appealing fringe benefits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The beauty of a sleek ponytail is that it looks good on everyone,” says hairstylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dimitris Giannetos</a>, a favorite of Megan Fox and Joey King, who adds that the high and slicked pony is a practical, chic means of elevating an outfit while keeping your hair out of your face (and snatching it at the same time). “It provides a natural facelift and emphasizes your most beautiful features.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike the slicked-back bun, which is all about pulling lengths taut in favor of a seamless style, the high ponytail lends itself to a polished look while still offering an opportunity to showcase your individual texture and striking facial features. “Generally speaking, a perfect sleek high ponytail helps to frame the face, holds the same position all day, and has no flyaways,” says celebrity hairstylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Andrew Fitzsimons</a>.“It’s super versatile and great for any occasion.” He’s right: day or night, casual or formal, happy hour or gym time, all are worthy opportunities to swing through with the ultimate of ponies.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So whether you want an elevated everyday aesthetic or a going-out updo that exudes maximum style with minimal effort, here’s how to pull together the perfect high ponytail.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-execute-a-snatched-ponytail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Execute a Snatched Ponytail</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The high ponytail may seem like a low-maintenance look, but anyone who has attempted to carry off a sleek, flyaway-free updo knows that styling can be a bit of a struggle. Fortunately, there are ways to make the process a seamless and successful one. “A sleek pony is such a high-end style, but so easy to achieve,” assures Giannetos. “The key to a high, sleek ponytail is working in sections and using the right products.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For optimal bounce and polish within the pony portion itself, Fitzsimons suggests working with clean hair—or at least hair spritzed in a dry shampoo like his own&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Discreet AF Dry Shampoo</a>. “Slicked-back ponytails are a great way to hide oily roots, and a good dry shampoo helps to add some grit to strands to help it hold its position nicely,” he explains. Giannetos recommends applying&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Dae Cactus Fruit 3-In-1 Styling Cream</a>&nbsp;to smooth the hair before detangling and then beginning to form your pony with a boar bristle brush. “Begin in the front center of the head, brushing the hair back to the preferred placement point. Then follow with the left and right side, then finally the back,” he says. Though many high ponytails feature a crown that’s combed-backed entirely, leaving a slight center part at the front can provide the same amount of polish via a more flattering frame, so play around a bit before settling on your signature style.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of positioning, a centered style is your best bet. “I like to center the pony on the crown of the head and create added lift from there,” says Fitzsimons. Finish by securing it with your preferred elastic band. “Once your pony is in place, tame flyaways by spraying a fine tooth comb with a soft-hold hair spray (such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Andrew Fitzsimons Touch Soft Hold Hairspray</a>) and gently comb along the top and sides.” For added shine, Giannetos reaches for a lightweight hair oil like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Raw Sugar Living Endless Hair Glow</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-best-ways-to-accessorize-a-high-ponytail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Best Ways to Accessorize a High Ponytail</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While a sleek high ponytail shines on its own, it also provides a stylish jumping-off point. “Adding accessories—fun ribbons, bows, or even pins—allows you to elevate this look even more while adding dimension and your own self-expression,” says Giannetos. The ponytail provides the ideal foundation for many trending accessories, from the ribbons that owned recent runways to the headband renaissance. Plaits can factor in, too, either via a diminutive braid accenting the crown or an entirely woven pony that makes a major statement.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sticking to accessories? Simply slide a chic headband over your combed crown or top your chosen hair tie with a black satin ribbon to transmute your pony from pared-down to played-up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-downsides-of-the-sleek-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Downsides of the Sleek Pony</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A sleek high ponytail should stay in your styling rotation, but regular reliance on the updo comes with some caveats. Too tight ponies can&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>result in headaches</a>&nbsp;along with aesthetic merit. Additionally, the sleek ponytail calls for a fair amount of styling, so be gentle with your strands as you coax them into place to prevent unnecessary breakage (and subsequent frizz to tame). Overuse of the updo can even lead to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>hair loss</a>&nbsp;(also known as&nbsp;traction alopecia), so give hair and scalp a break between tie-backs.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qWcnqNdnbaotIyppqexpJa2rXmXbWdtaGFs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
