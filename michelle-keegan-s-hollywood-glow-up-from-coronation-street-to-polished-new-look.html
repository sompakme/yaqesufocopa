Following her high school education, before landing a big role on TV, she was studying at the Manchester School of Acting while working in retail on the side.</p><p>In late 2007, Tina McIntyre hit the cobbles.

Michelle embraced getting all dolled up for these nights out and we love this blue dress on her which complements her signature bronzed look beautifully.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ae73b448ba68-michelle-keegan-2008.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">A star is born</h2><p>The actress made quite the mark in her role in and picked up a number of awards along the way, including this one from the TV Choice Awards in 2008. A 21-year-old Michelle looks dazzling in this gold and black dress.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/6d133501e29b-2009.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Lady in red</h2><p>A great perk of being a celebrity is that you get access to the best stylists and glam squad – not that the stunning Michelle needs it! But in this photo, you can really see the actress has elevated her fashion game and looks incredible in this floor-length red gown.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16644fe4e194-michelle-keegan-in-2012.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">A new look</h2><p>By the time 2012 comes around, Michelle is rocking a more sophisticated look which is shown here in this monochrome ensemble.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember disco pants? They were all the rage around this time and the TV star looked fabulous in these shiny trousers paired with platform heels. We are also big fans of her seriously glossy hair.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c2d930d4e75-michelle-and-mark-soap-awards.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Love is in the air</h2><p>In late 2012, Michelle began datingstar and her now-husband <a href=#><strong>Mark Wright</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>It wasn't long before the two became a power couple.</p><p>One of their most memorable nights out together in the early days of their romance came in 2013 when they stepped out looking totally 'couple goals' at the British Soap Awards. That night, Michelle won the award for Best Actress.</p><p>Michelle's look at the awards showed a real change in her red carpet style. It's clear that Michelle was working with a brilliant fashion and beauty team as her hair and makeup here are on point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/426938d32a51-michelle-and-mark.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Saying goodbye to the cobbles</h2><p>Around the same time she and Mark became serious, Michelle decided to walk away from her role as Tina McIntyre after almost six years. Her last episode aired in 2014 when this photo of her and her beau was taken.</p><p>The couple were often spotted out together looking glam-as-ever, and this cute snap from the back of a cab shows just how in love the gorgeous couple are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee18893f2f46-michelle-2015.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Fashionista</h2><p>And it wasn't only acting that Michelle was thriving in, by 2015, the star had put out a number of collections with fashion brands, Lipsy of London.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Michelle still has a passion for fashion and has her own collection with Very which, unsurprisingly, is a hit with her fans.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/93bf4de12d4d-michelle-2019-at-global-awards.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Glitz and glamour</h2><p>This photo is from the Global Awards in 2019 and, by this point, Michelle had been in the public eye for more than a decade. And so, like all of us, the actress has of course changed over the years.</p><p>Her gorgeous glow-up is evident in this photo where she's rocking slightly fuller brows, more in line with the beauty trends of today, and highlights in her hair to add dimension. Gorgeous!<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1af9fd40e1bb-michelle-2023.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Hollywood calling</h2><p>How stunning is this look? Michelle attended the British Fashion Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London at the end of 2023 rubbing shoulders with other famous faces.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that Michelle has reached international fame thanks to her Netflix show – could Hollywood be calling? We certainly think so. &nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqaWBrhHC5yJyfnqScmnqsscSgmKerXZ28rbjYsKaonF2cubDDjK6nZp6ipLpur86rpqeZpJ68r3nSramenaRiwbB5z6ijoquYmrFuusSwZKWnn6B8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
