The first dismissed was Justin Falconer. Although Judge Delucchi did not explain why he was dismissed, <a href=#>CNN</a> reports Falconer was seen talking to Laci Peterson's brother, Brent Rocha, while they were passing through court security. Falconer said he told Rocha, "I'm ruining the shot for the news tonight. You're not going to be on the news tonight."</p><p dir=ltr>Falconer said he was jokingly referring to the fact that the media could not use video footage or photos with jurors included. However, some members of the media, who overheard the remark, said Falconer actually said, "You're going to lose tonight."</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by <a href=#>CNN</a>, Juror number seven, who was later identified as Fran Gorman, was dismissed during deliberations for "conducting independent research" about the case. Per the court rules, jurors are prohibited from conducting their own research into a case and are instructed to base their decision solely on information presented during the trial.</p><p dir=ltr>Judge Alfred Delucchi also dismissed the jury foreman, who was later identified as Gregory Jackson, during the deliberations. Although Delucchi did not explain why he dismissed Jackson, CNN analysts said he likely "violated the judge's instructions."</p><p dir=ltr>Following the dismissals of Fran Gorman and Gregory Jackson, the jury was required to restart deliberations. However, Judge Delucchi refused to declare a mistrial.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCBmGlvcXFfrLWiwIyiq2avkah6rbXKnmSsnaKrtq%2BzjKilZqyYmnq0r86tq2aolamys7%2FOp2SjraKufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
