The Texan emcee's delivered a whole lot of music, including two projects, and it doesn't look like he has any sort of intention of slowing down in the near future. Most recently, his record label Reach came through with a new playlist of some of the hottest releases of the past month and compiled them into a playlist that came along with a few new songs. Today, LeCrae teams up with Andy Mineo to deliver a brand new banger.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">LeCrae comes through with Andy Mineo for their new collaboration, "Coming In Hot." The new track comes shortly after the release of LeCrae's joint mixtape with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Zaytoven</a>,&nbsp;Let The Trap Say Amen.&nbsp;The track is a massive banger with a tinge of EDM influence on the production. It's a massive single from both artists. Keep your eyes peeled for more music from both LeCrae and Andy Mineo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics<br></strong></span>What's happenin?<br>I'mma need y'all quit askin' when<br>Me and my wife gon' have some kids<br>Right now, we just practicin'<br>Practicin', teacher told me quit rappin' man<br>That gon' hurt my average<br>I said, thank God I ain't average</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
