We know that is really going to support tradies right across Greater Sydney who will also be able to access this rebate,” Mr Perrottet said.</p><p>“We know that tolls have an impact on businesses on families.”</p><p>Small business minister Damien Tudehope said the government wanted to give small businesses “assurance”.</p><p>“The rebate can be used to offset NSW and local government fees and charges and adding tolls to the list of claimable charges is going to make a massive difference to many small business owners who use vehicles for work,” he said.<br></p><p>As part of the new package, small businesses will also be able to apply for a stock rebate of up to $20,000 if lockdown keeps them shut over summer.</p><p>Businesses with an annual turnover between $75,000 and $50 million will be able to apply.<br></p><p>However, Mr Perrottet said lockdowns would be a “last resort’ going forward and promised businesses to have confidence to purchase stock, particularly ahead of Christmas.</p><p>“I have made it very, very clear that (lockdown) is a last resort,” he said.</p><p>“This will give confidence to businesses to purchase stock (because we are offering) a rebate of up to $20,000 of perishable goods, $10,000 for non-perishable goods.</p><p>“(This) will give businesses the confidence to buy up big, to get ready for a major summer trade.</p><p>“It’s going to be boom time in NSW for every single business and every single worker across our state.”</p><p>The Premier also praised Sydney residents for their behaviour on the first day of new freedoms.</p><p>“We have spoken a lot, over the last few days, particularly about the tolerance, respect and kindness that we wanted people to show over the course of this difficult period,” he said.</p><p>“That was in full display from the people of our state yesterday.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnymr86npqaxX5m8rrXNoppmqJWnv7DA056rZqqVq7KiuNJmpZ6vXaWupLfAoJxmr5iesKl51qKjpWWRobmww4ytqZqcmZrAbsDOZpqlmZmierO7wJ1kraecocBwusSwqmarpKS%2FunuTbJ1ubZFsfad%2BmG5paWhhmLNxsJaabm%2BZZJaAcq%2BSag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
