She was born Sally Lowenthal on February 25, 1935 in Easton, Pennsylvania and is best known for her own talk show, Sally Jessy Raphael, and her signature red-framed glasses.<br><b>Sally Jessy Raphael is a member of <a href=#>Richest Celebrities</a></b><h2>Age, Biography and Wiki</h2><h2><span class=inline-icon>ðŸ’°</span> Net worth: $40 Million <i>(2024)</i></h2><p>Raphael studied broadcasting and acting while in college and began her career as a correspondent in Puerto Rico before coming to U.S. radio and television during the '60s, where she continued to grow her career over the next two decades. In the early '80s, Raphael caught the attention of Maurice Tunick, producer of Talknet (NBC's syndicated nighttime radio-in shows), and he decided to test her on a one-hour trial run on WRC in Washington, D.C. Her warm and personal take on the forum won him over and she secured a position that would establish her as a confidant on national radio, expertly bridging private and public realms with her caring but professional manner. Her television talk show, Sally Jessy Raphael, hit the air in 1983 and enjoyed success until 2002. Again, her easy rapport with an audienceâ€”a live studio audience this timeâ€”struck a chord with her audience and the talk show was a hit. The show did receive some major criticism for what some considered 'morally marginal' topics and discussions, but Raphael believes she helped people and exposed problems and social stigmas that had never been aired prior to her show. Since the ending of the Sally Jessy Raphael show, Raphael has gone on to host internet and radio shows.</p><p>Salary: In September 1993, at the peak of her show's popularity, Sally signed the largest contract of her career. That deal with production company Multimedia Inc. paid Sally $25 million over five years. After adjusting for inflation, that contract was worth approximately $44 million, around $9 million per year before taxes. She signed one more contract that paid slightly less until the show ended in 2002. Sally aired nearly 4000 episodes over its run.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejlrmtxYyjnKyrqWK%2ForzHmpylZZ6awW7DzquroWVibIR6hJc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
