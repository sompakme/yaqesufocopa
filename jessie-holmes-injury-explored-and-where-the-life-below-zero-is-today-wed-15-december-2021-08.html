However, the latest episode showed that the scar from the accident has mostly healed.</p><p>The Life Below Zero star said the doctor gave him the go-ahead to start getting some movement in his arm. He was also told to “keep any kind of impact down” for the next five to six weeks (from filming).</p><p>He is now well enough to train for more races, including two teams signed up for Iditarod this year. Jessie plans to re-enter the mid-distance circuit and seems more active on his Instagram.</p><p>However, he did say the injury would change his outlook on his summer. Jessie said: “I feel like I was meant to have this wake-up call and it just puts things into perspective for me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jessie Holmes (@jessie_holmes__)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-jessie-have-a-wife>Does Jessie have a wife?</h2><p>Jessie is not currently married, and hasn’t confirmed being in a relationship.</p><p>However, recent pictures with a woman named Julie suggest she could be his girlfriend.
