Every other statement was coming back to Kim-Jong Un and how he’s going to be in the history books. I’m like, ‘No. We’re talking about the Pistons. No Korea! No! Stay with me.' [...]&nbsp;“He’s like, ’10 hours, huh? I’ll give you 10 minutes. So he sits down, I’m just shooting with him, and he says, ‘I need a tuna sub from Subway and some chamomile tea.'”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Essentially, getting answers out of Rodman was like pulling teeth without any anesthetics. Regardless, the job got done and they were able to get the answers they needed out of him.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
