The unexpected should have been expected, as even the main event of the night changed during the beginning of the show. There were many newsworthy moments, and fans shouldn’t have expected any less from Tony Khan’s company.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News provided full coverage of AEW Full Gear</a>. It was quite a show, and there was no shortage of talking points throughout the event. Will Ospreay was a big surprise at Full Gear, and he has a lot ahead of him.</p><p>During the media scrum after AEW Full Gear, <a href=#>Will Ospreay had chance to explain</a> why he picked AEW. Later on, Chris Jericho commented on Ospreay signing with the company, and this is something The Wizard is all for.</p><p>“I’m really happy about Will coming to AEW. I talked to him on the phone about it a year and a half ago, maybe. I think the London match we had was great, it was one of the best matches on the show, if not the best match. That’s what Will does. I think this is one of the greatest career years for a pro wrestler, either.”</p><p>Chris Jericho also said that Will Ospreay has a character that is “believable” and he will get to show more of that in AEW. Jericho also said that this was one of the best moves that either party could have made. Obviously, Jericho is very excited about the idea of having Will Ospreay in the AEW locker room.</p><p>We will have to see what 2024 holds for the AEW roster. At this rate, the sky is the limit as they bring in someone like Will Ospreay.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on this booking call for AEW Full Gear?
