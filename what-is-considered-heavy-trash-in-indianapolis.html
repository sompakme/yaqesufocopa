One Yourself)</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:27><span>Let's face it,</span><span> Indianapolis,</span><span> sometimes our domestic endeavors lead to the creation of...</span><span>well,</span><span> let's just say not-so-charming discards.</span><span> That old mattress that feels like it's been possessed by a rogue spring,</span><span> the refrigerator that resembles a science experiment gone wrong – these are the bulky beasts that refuse to fit in your regular trash cart.</span><span> But fear not,</span><span> fellow waste warriors!</span><span> This guide will have you tackling heavy trash like a champ,</span><span> without turning your curb into a landfill monument.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:2><strong>What qualifies as a "Heavy Beast" in Indy?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:155><span>Think of it this way:</span><span> if your trash cart looks at an item and whimpers,</span><span> it's probably heavy trash.</span><span> Here's a bestiary of some common bulky beastly suspects:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-10:167><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:149><strong>Furniture:</strong><span> That wobbly coffee table?</span><span> The couch that's seen more Netflix than sunlight?</span><span> These are prime candidates for heavy trash collection.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=10:1-10:167><strong>Appliances (Freon-free!):</strong><span> Washing machines that have forgotten how to wash,</span><span> ovens that haven't seen a baking sheet in years – they can all be banished with the heavy trash crew (but </span><strong>only</strong><span> if they don't contain Freon – that requires a special call to the Mayor's Action Center,</span><span> folks).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=11:1-12:0><strong>Other Bulky Items:</strong><span> Think old tires (with rims,</span><span> please!</span><span>),</span><span> carpet remnants that resemble a lost shag rug civilization,</span><span> and grills that haven't sizzled a burger in decades.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:264><strong>Important Note:</strong><span> This ain't a free-for-all,</span><span> you magnificent trash tamers.</span><span> You can only put out </span><strong>two</strong><span> heavy trash items on your designated heavy trash day.</span><span> </span><strong>Three's a crowd</strong><span>,</span><span> and that crowd might just leave your monstrous discards high and dry on the curb.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:38><strong>How to slay the Heavy Trash Beast:</strong></p><li data-sourcepos=17:1-17:182><strong>Know your

fight:</strong><span> </span><strong>Break down large items</strong><span> if possible.</span><span> That entertainment center won't win against a little disassembly.</span></li><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:201><strong>Remember:</strong><span> Yard waste,</span><span> construction debris,</span><span> and hazardous materials are not part of the heavy trash crew.</span><span> These
