Responding to a carousel of photos which showed Milo collecting his high school diploma, the 69-year-old replied: "This weekend together as a family was so perfect!! Yay Milo! Yay Livvy for making it all so special!!"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/42dd57879f07-liv-tyler-son-milo-daughter-lula.jpg><p id=enzOLBPKBYy data-wc=42>For her son's big day, Liv delivered a masterclass in dopamine dressing as she teamed a bright fuchsia blouse with cherry red pants and strappy sandals. Styling her hair in a sleek bun, the 46-year-old completed her look with radiant, pared-back makeup.&nbsp;</p><p id=en8JOAe5Ou6 data-wc=43>Adorably, Liv's sons Milo and Sailor Gene twinned in navy suits at the former's graduation.

Having children, I learned about my own strength."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c637514f41d0-liv-tyler.jpg><p id=e9ui_M6MLag data-wc=60>Reflecting on how she juggle kids and her career, Liv explained: "I feel like I'm conducting a giant orchestra, because there's so many moving parts. It's like, 'Over there, you guys do that!' And then, 'Over there, you do this! All together now!' It's kind of what it feels like to be a mom, isn't it? In the modern world?"</p><p id=eguG76VMVTI data-wc=92>As for how she feels about her children being in the spotlight, in 2017, Liv told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Kit</a>: "I just want them to be able to enjoy their lives and their friends and their schoolwork. I go off to work and I come home, and I try not to talk about it too much. They understand that sometimes I get dressed up and go out at night. When Milo was a baby and we were night-shooting for The Incredible Hulk, he told all his friends at the park, 'My mommy works nights.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZVwa2xnnJ7DbsDYpZyrZZOauaau0ZqrnqtdqLyvecyio6hlmJ60qXnSnJ%2Bop5xitLOtw66YraGfo3qxtM6tpqxlp57BqXnLqKakmZyeuKZ5wqGgpZyimrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
