We’ve got to be willing to be open,” he said at one point. “I’m telling you, you’re standing before a man who had to forgive a man who never showed up ever. And look what I made with it. Look what I was able to ‘usher’ in. But that’s what’s real. That’s what makes us human. That’s what makes us women and men.” Check out his full unfiltered speech below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-usher-receives-lifetime-achievement-award>Usher Receives Lifetime Achievement Award</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition to the speech, several artists including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Childish Gambino</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chloe Bailey</a> performed tributes for the legendary singer.
