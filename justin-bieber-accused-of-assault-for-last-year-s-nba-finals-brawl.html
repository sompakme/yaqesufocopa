Bieber exchanging shoves and jabs with a man, before he gets plowed&nbsp;into a door and then taken down. It could've been much worse for the Canadian superstar, as the man -- who looks to be about twice his size -- was restrained by a group of bystanders shortly after Bieber hit the ground.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though Bieber looks to have narrowly avoided a severe beating, his opponent is the one who's claiming to be the victim in the violent encounter. He has filed a police report in which he says he was assaulted by the 22-year-old pop star.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He alleges that Bieber instigated the altercation by grabbing his sunglasses. The accuser says that Bieber got violent when he tried to take a picture of him wearing the stolen shades. Though the previously leaked footage doesn't seem to show Bieber's opponent sustaining any injuries, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">TMZ</a>&nbsp;reports that he told police that "Bieber's crew then got in on the action."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The victim claims that he went to the hospital that night and even sustained a concussion. One would think that if he did get injured, then it would have been due to the actions of Bieber's entourage. As he's hitting the singer with assault accusations, though, perhaps he's suggesting that Bieber ordered his men to give him a beating.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For now, there is no evidence other than last summer's video. According to TMZ, the man took so long to file charges because he has allegedly been trying to strike a settlement deal with Bugatti Biebs, to no avail. Police report that no charges have yet been filed and that the investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature &amp;amp; News Contributor&lt;/b> Brooklyn via Toronto writer and music enthusiast.
