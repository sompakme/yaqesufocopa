Last year, T.I. visited a podcast and stated that he accompanies Deyjah, who was 17 at the time, to the gynecologist. He said that he requests that the doctor examine her thoroughly to make sure that she wasn't sexually active and that her hymen was still intact.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The response to his remarks&nbsp;came in like a tsunami, and soon people had named the social media scandal "Hymengate." On tonight's (June 15) episode of the show, Deyjah stated that she was "shocked, hurt, angry, and embarrassed" by the ordeal and&nbsp;added that she and T.I. weren't very close at the moment. The teen was tearful as she&nbsp;said that this incident caused their father-daughter relationship to be changed forever, but he would still be her father.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Later, she told her cousins that she struggled with how differently T.I. treated her brothers, especially King. Deyjah Harris said that T.I. jokes that King will one day be someone's "baby daddy," but holds her under his thumb. It seems that one of the few people who came to Deyjah's defense was&nbsp;T.I.'s mother, Violeta, who was horrified to hear T.I. confirm his statements about Deyjah. He also added that since Deyjah didn't find the need to confront him about his comments, which he said&nbsp;were just a joke, he didn't think he should pay any attention to it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During an interview she conducted in April, Tameka "Tiny" Harris said that T.I. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"had no malicious intent</a>" when he made those initial&nbsp;remarks about his daughter.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
