But this time, instead of it being a new product launch, family drama, or a highly publicized date night with her boyfriend, Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, Kim is turning heads in her new, practically topless <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Vogue Hong Kong</a> feature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In one striking <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>image</a> from the photo shoot for the April 2022 issue, Kardashian wore nothing but black sheer stockings and a matching tulle veil by Schiaparelli. While in a seated position, the shape-wear mogul posed with her elbow on one knee. The see-through fabric covered her head, flowed down her back, and over her arms and midsection. One of her perfectly manicured hands held the piece in place as she looked into the camera with her hair in a topknot and accessorized with Bvlgari Serpenti white gold diamond drop earrings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the actual cover, the law student posed in a plunging black (her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>go-to color these days, which her daughter, North West, hates</a>) Fendi suit, with a paperclip-like fastening holding the blazer in place. In this photo, her long hair was down in gentle waves made to look wet, one of the beauty muse's go-to looks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the interview, the billionaire businesswoman opened up about her fashion sense and evolution, SKIMS, the family's upcoming Hulu show, The Kardashians, social media, and law school. She says her late father, Robert Kardashian, who served on O.J. Simpson's "dream team" during the infamous '90s trial, inspired her to practice law. She even has hopes "of one day creating a successful law firm."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Doing this work has been in my soul for years and I'm so proud that I'm now doing this work," she told the publication. "When I look back at old interviews, when people asked what I wanted to do if I wasn't filming KUWTK [Keeping Up With the Kardashians], I always said I wanted to be a crime scene investigator or an attorney. Being in this line of work has definitely made me feel closer to my dad and to know that I'm helping people feels really good at the end of the day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the last couple years, Kim has been studying for the baby bar exam, which she failed three times before passing it late last year. "The experience taught me so much and I've never worked so hard on something in my life," she said. "I had to be really diligent about studying and dedicated every spare minute I had to it. I'm very passionate about criminal justice reform and I want to advocate for those who I feel were wrongfully convicted."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZaeawLV7yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlo52ypr6Mr5yipF2owbCvyqKloKtdl66jxYybmKtlla2urnnVqJ6unV2dvK%2BzjKSmp58%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
