Those parts were hard for me to write and I second guessed what people would think, but I know that those experiences are not exclusively mine.

And I had always wondered how sick I was on the spectrum, – 'Oh, I'm not that bad, there are people who are worse than me,' – but to see that review made me realize I really was that bad, and I really did find my way out.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eUxiu1ieBft data-wc=50>I have conversations about my disorder with my children often; when I decided to go into recovery, I made them watch those episodes so that they understood what I was embarking on, and I also would point out to them, 'Look what mommy's eating now'.</p><p id=eqL1JCMJNTq data-wc=82>Three of my kids are boys, and the concept of starving yourself is almost foreign to them but I have a 13-year-old daughter, Alexis, and every day that she gets older, she's more and more conscious of her body. She complains about her body sometimes even though she's beautiful, and<strong>&nbsp;I struggle to find the right words because I want her to love herself,</strong> no matter what, but I also know how hard it was for me to be a young girl.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHWI3CTiU2 data-wc=49>But after 20 years I still have some weirdness around food and I struggle to find the right words to use so I just try to model really good behavior in front of her, and encourage her to enjoy food, eat everything in moderation and to get physical exercise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2ffcd70833d8-gettyimages-1694063012.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How I use my morning self-care routine to hack my happiness" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a0bc8b25b8a4-shutterstock2213192151.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How I use my morning self-care routine to hack my happiness" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How I use my morning self-care routine to hack my happiness</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How my breast cancer diagnosis took me on the path to unexpected happiness" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/38fd391fff89-greatwallofchina.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How my breast cancer diagnosis took me on the path to unexpected happiness" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How my breast cancer diagnosis took me on the path to unexpected happiness</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Do you need an awe break?

It wasn't until recently, and hearing how her grandparents escaped the Holocaust for a Russian refugee camp where her grandfather would trade valuables for potatoes, that her relationship with food made sense to me.</p><p id=eF6Xj4-NK4 data-wc=74>I am 47 now and when you are younger you think that your parents should be perfect people and have all the answers, but later you realize they were just doing their best.
