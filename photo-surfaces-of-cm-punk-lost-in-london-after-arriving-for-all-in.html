Things got off to a rocky start when he arrived in London, and it didn’t get much better from that point on.</p><p><a href=#>We previously reported that</a> CM Punk got lost after he arrived in London for All In. AEW did not send anyone to meet Punk at the airport, so he was left to his own devices.</p><p>Thankfully, CM Punk is resourceful and that wasn’t the first time he traveled in his life, as Haus of Wrestling broke the story.</p><p>“When CM Punk landed at Heathrow Airport for AEW: All In London on Saturday morning, no one from AEW was there to greet him. There was also no car service to take him to his hotel, and when he texted a number he was given by AEW for the driver, it bounced back as being an invalid number.”</p><p>“After waiting for a while, Punk chose to buy a train ticket and find his own way to his hotel. We are told that The Tube was fairly busy at the time, Punk got lost, and a few fans who noticed The Second City Saint helped him figure out where he was going. It appears that Punk got into London so close to the actual event because he had taping commitments in Atlanta on Wednesday and wanted to spend Thursday with his wife and dog, Larry, before heading out on Friday and landing on Saturday morning.”</p><p>A photo has now emerged of CM Punk sitting on a car in London’s Tube system. As the report stated, Punk was spotted by fans, and apparently, one of them was able to snap a photo with the Second City Savior.</p><p>This photo of CM Punk sitting in London’s Tube system has gone viral. Now, plenty of fans can see exactly what Punk had to go through before All In. It’s also easy to see why Punk’s nerves might have been rubbed a bit raw prior to his backstage confrontation with Jack Perry.</p><p><a href=#>Tony Khan addressed that situation</a> regarding CM Punk’s fight with Jack Perry during his opening statement after All In London in the media scrum. He admitted that there was an incident and they are investigating the matter. <a href=#>The latest on this story is that Punk and Perry might be suspended </a>until that investigation concludes.</p><p>We will have to see what happens in this situation. At this point, CM Punk is telling people that he hates AEW.
