It was NEVER made legal,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>Deuxmoi wrote</a> on its Instagram story over a post from a user speculating about Swift relationships. “I will die on this hill! Put it on my tombstone! I have no reason to lie, I could give a shit what she does!!!!! I’m sorry she didn’t tell you guys about it in a song but just because she doesn’t sing about something doesn’t mean it didn’t happen!!!”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Late Thursday night, Paine posted a screenshot of the story to her X (formerly known as Twitter) account and wrote, “Enough is enough with these fabricated lies about Taylor from Deuxmoi. There was NEVER a marriage or ceremony of ANY kind. This is an insane thing to post. It’s time for you to be held accountable for the pain and trauma you cause with posts like these.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Enough is enough with these fabricated lies about Taylor from Deuxmoi.
