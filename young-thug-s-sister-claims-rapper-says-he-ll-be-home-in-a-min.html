The rapper was arrested in May 2022, along with over two dozen others. Prosecutors suggested Thugger was the ring leader of a YSL gang, but his defense claims the collective is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">only a record label</a>. At the moment, the jury selection portion of the trial is taking longer than expected. For months, potential jurors have been added and subtracted. It was recently announced it could take several more months before a final jury is decided upon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Thugger's loved ones and fans continue to take to social media to share their support. The rapper's<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> sister, Dolly White,</a> has also been vocal about Thug's circumstance, and she offered an update after conversing with him. "I talked to My Twin Jeff," White wrote on Instagram. "I told him I'm lonely out here without him. He said you supposed to be. I'll be home in a min. I miss tf out of him.

The rapper copped to an Alford plea, making him the first defendant to be discharged. Several others have followed, but Gunna has<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> faced allegations</a> of cooperating with the authorities. He has remained relatively quiet as his peers use social media to praise or criticize him. As the debates dragged on, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Gunna's attorney returned </a>with another denial of partnering with law enforcement.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“After reading [Jewel Wicker's] outstanding, insightful article, I am obliged to say for the record one more time: Gunna has never been interviewed by or cooperated with law enforcement or prosecutors in the RICO case,” said Steve Sadow. “Nor have his attorneys proffered information on his behalf. What was said at his Alford plea hearing was solely to resolve his own case. It cannot be used by the prosecution against Young Thug or any defendant."</p><span><h4 id=h-dolly-white-once-called-for-the-public-to-stop-talking-about-snitching>Dolly White Once Called For The Public To Stop Talking About Snitching</h4></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In December 2022, Dolly White further suggested she was tired of seeing the "rat" and "snitch" talks. “Can y’all please stop saying that people ratted and people this-and-that?” White said. “It’s not making anybody better, it’s not making nothing good, bro. Nothing that’s going on is[...]helping my brother. So, can y’all please stop that? If y’all love Gunna, then y’all give him support. Like, what the f*ck y’all over there doing? Y’all tripping.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
