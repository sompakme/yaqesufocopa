No matter when the Pixar/Disney production reached theaters, comparisons between the two computer-animated insect movies would be inevitable, but, with only seven weeks separating their openings, those comparisons will be more intense. Fortunately, <i>A Bug's Life</i> can withstand the scrutiny. Despite a number of similarities to <i>Antz</i>, there are enough variations in plot and tone to warrant another visit to the unique and wondrous world existing beneath the blades of grass.</p><p>In <i>A Bug's Life</i>, the protagonist is Flik (voice of Dave Foley), an ant whose sole desire in life is "to make a difference." Flik is an inventor, and, when one of his experiments goes wrong, it brings the wrath of the grasshoppers, led by the dangerous Hopper (Kevin Spacey), down upon the denizens of the ant hill. To protect the community, Flik, with the blessing of the ant queen (Phyllis Diller) and Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), ventures into the outside world and recruits "warrior insects" to defend the colony. The group of nine he collects is comprised of a praying mantis (Jonathan Harris, Mr. Smith from the TV version of "Lost in Space"), a butterfly (Madeline Kahn), a black widow spider (Bonnie Hunt), an unladylike ladybug (Denis Leary in a scene-stealing vocal performance), a walking stick (David Hyde Pierce, from TV's "Frasier"), a caterpillar with a German accent (Joe Ranft), a rhino beetle (Brad Garrett), and a pair of unintelligible pillbugs (Michael McShane). There is a mistake in identity, however. Flik's "warrior bugs" are actually circus insects, and they accompany him under the false assumption that he is a talent scout. Things start to unravel once the ant and his elite corps discover the truth about each other.</p><p>In a head-to-head comparison, it's easy to make an argument for either <i>Antz</i> or <i>A Bug's Life</i> as the best entry in almost every category that the two share. <i>Antz</i> contains somewhat more mature content; <i>A Bug's Life</i> is designed a little more with kids in mind. However, as is true of <i>Antz</i>, the story presented in <i>A Bug's Life</i> works well on two levels. Children will appreciate the likable characters and fast-paced adventure; adults will marvel at the skillful animation and subtle humor. For "star power," <i>Antz</i> undeniably comes out on top, with instantly-recognizable names like Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, and Gene Hackman (as opposed to David Foley, Denis Leary, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Kevin Spacey). But it's important to note that immediate voice recognition doesn't necessarily add anything to a performance (although, admittedly, it's fun to hear the banter between Allen and Stallone). The vocal acting in <i>A Bug's Life</i> is no less accomplished or effective than that in <i>Antz</i>. Visually, the films are both brilliantly detailed and wonderfully textured. <i>A Bug's Life</i> gives new dimensions to the diminutive world - a place where raindrops are dangerous projectiles, single berries provide full meals, and the most feared enemy is a bird. And, while most of <i>Antz</i> relies on earthy tones, <i>A Bug's Life</i> explodes with a cacophony of color. Of the three computer-animated feature length films to reach the screen thus far, this is the most dazzling.</p><p>One thing <i>A Bug's Life</i> has that <i>Antz</i> does not is a ingenious series of end credits. Instead of just the latest lame Randy Newman song warbling over scrolling names, we are presented with a collection of mocked-up outtakes that parody the kinds of flubs and goofs which have come to decorate the credits of numerous comedies. It's brilliant in both conception and execution, and one could make a solid case that the last three minutes of <i>A Bug's Life</i> are its best. I wouldn't go that far, but this is definitely a movie when it's a good idea not to run for the exit as soon as the story ends.</p><p>Pixar is the studio that first brought a full-length computer-generated feature to the screen with 1995's <a href=#><i>Toy Story</i></a>, and, by adding <i>A Bug's Life</i> to their resume, they have established themselves as a force to be reckoned with not only in the realm of animated films, but in that of family entertainment in general. (Disney must be delighted to be in partnership with them.) Co-directors John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton understand that every story, even one with such an intense focus on visual elements, begins with a script and characters. <i>A Bug's Life</i>, like <i>Toy Story</i>, develops protagonists we can root for, and places them in the midst of a fast-moving, energetic adventure. And, while <i>Antz</i> and <i>A Bug's Life</i> each work well enough on their own, they are best when seen in concert, if only to compare and contrast the fine craft evident in such top-notch examples of family entertainment.</p><h2>Bug's Life, A (United States, 1998)</h2>Director: <a title="View all reviews for movies directed by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton" href=#>John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton</a><br>Cast: <a title="View all reviews for movies starring (voice) Dave Foley" href=#>(voice) Dave Foley</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Joe Ranft" href=#>Joe Ranft</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Hayden Panettiere" href=#>Hayden Panettiere</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Denis Leary" href=#>Denis Leary</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Richard Kind" href=#>Richard Kind</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Madeline Kahn" href=#>Madeline Kahn</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring David Hyde Pierce" href=#>David Hyde Pierce</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Bonnie Hun" href=#>Bonnie Hun</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Jonathan Harris" href=#>Jonathan Harris</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Brad Garrett" href=#>Brad Garrett</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Phyllis Diller" href=#>Phyllis Diller</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus" href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring Kevin Spacey" href=#>Kevin Spacey</a>, <a title="View all reviews for movies starring John Ratzenberger" href=#>John Ratzenberger</a><br>Screenplay: <a href=# title="ReelViews for movies with screenplay written by Andrew Stanton, Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw">Andrew Stanton, Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw</a><br>Cinematography: <a href=# title="ReelViews for movies with cinematographer Sharon Calahan">Sharon Calahan</a><br>Music: <a href=# title="ReelViews for movies with music written by Randy Newman">Randy Newman</a><br>U.S. Distributor: Walt Disney Pictures <span class=st_twitter_large displaytext=Tweet></span> <span class=st_facebook_large displaytext=Facebook></span> <span class=st_googleplus_large displaytext="Google +"></span> <span class=st_email_large displaytext=Email></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HEpa2inaeoe6%2Bx02ipnp2cq7amw9Joma6fXah6rbXFnmSa</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
