So what do we know about the OJ Simpson trial now? Here are the most significant discoveries.</p><h3>OJ Simpson hid in Kim Kardashian's room&nbsp;</h3><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Robert Kardashian, Simpson's defence attorney.&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: &nbsp;REX FEATURES&nbsp;</span></figure><p>One of the most tantalising scenes in the series predictably involves a reference to the Kardashians, who have been inextricably linked with the show thanks to their father Robert Kardashian's involvement as Simpson's <a href=#>defence attorney</a>. In the first episode, OJ Simpson is told by Ropert Shapiro that there is a warrant for arrest, which spurs him to try and kill himself in the young Kim Kardashian's bedroom.</p><p>The producers have been accused of gratuitously featuring the young Kardashian children&nbsp;to draw their fanbase to the programme, which doesn't seem unreasonable when we see Kardashian plead,&nbsp;"O.J., no, please, this is the room where my daughter sleeps...&nbsp;please don’t kill yourself in Kimmy’s bedroom!” Just in case we forgot that she was alive at the time.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The Marcia Clark nude photos</span></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Sarah Paulson left, plays Marcia Clark, the trial's chief prosecutor.&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: BBC</span></figure><p>In Tuesday's episode, American Crime Story depicted the moment&nbsp;Marcia Clark, the trial's chief prosecutor, found out the mother of her ex-husband had sold topless&nbsp;photos of her with her husband on the beach to tabloid magazine The Enquirer.</p><p>We see Clark, played by Sarah Paulson, enter the courtroom the next day amid intense stares from everyone in the room. As soon as she sits down, close to tears, the judge, Lance Ito (played by Kenneth Choi) announces he is recessing court until the next day. Clark told People magazine in a recent interview that&nbsp;"It didn't bother me as much on a personal level as it did professionally.&nbsp;Everyone forgot about&nbsp;murder victims Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson, and it became this enormous circus."</p><h3>The knife found on OJ's property</h3><p>The OJ Simpson chapter of American Crime Story coincided with <a href=#>the discovery of a knife found &nbsp;buried on OJ Simpson's former&nbsp;property. </a>LA police are testing a knife that someone claiming to be a construction worker gave to an off-duty police officer, who, astonishingly,&nbsp;kept it as a souvenir, thinking the case was closed.</p><p>Now that the knife has been recovered, police are testing it for DNA and hair samples. Some doubt was cast on whether the knife, which was a utility-type model not consistent with the one used in the crime, was connected with the case, with police suggesting it could be "bogus".&nbsp;</p><h3>Marcia Clark's perm</h3><span></span><p>American Crime Story&nbsp;&nbsp;is excellent at depicting the sexism Clark suffered during the trial - a successful professional lawyer, her appearance was continually criticised by a media circus thirsty for stories. The show movingly depicts the moment Clark appears in court with a&nbsp;new perm that was bashed by the press.</p><p>At the time of the actual trial, Clark had two small children; she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Cut</a> in a recent interview that she deliberately chose "wash and wear hair" that was "easy", given that she was a working mother.</p><p>While this now seems&nbsp;completely reasonable to us, when Clark changed her tresses mid-trial the&nbsp;courtroom applauded, and her hairdresser was&nbsp;contacted by 30&nbsp;media outlets for quotes. The appalling&nbsp;extent of the&nbsp;scrutiny Clark suffered because of her appearance during the trial, when she was trying to focus on the biggest case of her professional life,&nbsp;makes for sombre watching.&nbsp;</p><h3>Prosecutor Christopher Darden's teeth</h3><p>Prosecutor Christopher Darden, played by Sterling&nbsp;K. Brown, never smiled because during his childhood his teeth rotted, meaning&nbsp;he had to replace them with implants. Brown said of his character,&nbsp;“usually the only time that I smile is when I’m in the presence of Marcia because Marcia’s that one person that allows [Darden] to feel comfortable with who he is as a person.”</p><h3>Khloe Kardashian's paternity kwestions</h3><span></span><p>Khloe's father, Robert Kardashian, was the chief defence lawyer in the OJ Simpson trial. Khloe, Kim and Kourtney are played by child actors in the show, shown gathering around the TV excitedly as Kardashian reads out Simpson's suicide note.</p><p>&nbsp;But now an ex-wife of Kardashian has claimed in an interview that Khloe is not the biological daughter of the lawyer, causing Khloe to slam the rumours on her TV show Cocktails with Khloe, saying,&nbsp;“She wanted to come out 10 years after my dad passed away&nbsp;and say I’m not my dad’s daughter.&nbsp;And he confided in her. I was like you can talk about me and my sisters all you f**king want. Do not talk about my dad.”</p><h3>OJ's former manager says he knows who killed Nicole</h3><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>OJ Simpson with lawyers Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran during the infamous trial.</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Norman Pado, the former manager of OJ Simpson, told&nbsp;KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO: "I know who did it and I know why they did it.&nbsp;I just can’t disclose it right now.”&nbsp;When asked why neither he nor Simpson had passed on this information to police, he said that officers took all of his 'stuff regarding the incidents'. &nbsp;</p><p>He added: "We had people working on it, and when we talked to the police about it, they raided my office and took it all." It remains to be seen how this bizarre revelation will be treated by police.&nbsp;</p><h3>OJ Simpson is protected by double jeopardy</h3><p>Even if the recently found knife is connected to the case, Simpson is protected by double jeopardy, a law which states he cannot be prosecuted for the crime again because the US constitution prohibits it. So ultimately the renewed police investigations may not lead to any dramatic results.</p><h3>Robert Kardashian was very religious</h3><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>David Schwimmer plays Robert Kardashian.&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: BBC</span></figure><p>It's difficult to understand why Robert Kardashian joined Hollywood lawyer Robert&nbsp;Shapiro's defence team, despite the fact he was close friends with Simpson. So many people<a href=#> thought Simpson was guilty </a>of heinous crimes, so why did Kardashian do it?</p><p>David Schwimmer, who plays Kardashian, spoke to his ex-wife Kris Jenner about the topic for several hours, and she revealed "that he was very religious, a man of great faith, that was one of the keys to understanding how he could make this decision. Even when there might have been huge uncertainty in his own heart, he had decided his place was not to judge.”</p><h3>One of the police offers committed perjury</h3><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>OJ Simpson trying on the gloves believed to have been worn by the murderer.&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>The show had access to material never before released fully, such as tape recordings of interviews given by Los Angeles <a href=#>police officer Mark Fuhrman</a>, who claimed to have found the blood-soaked glove&nbsp;that would be pivotal during the trial. Furhman claimed not to have used the&nbsp;word "n***er" in 10 years, but tapes proved that he had.</p><p>Recorded between 1985 and 1994, he can&nbsp;also be heard boasting of police brutality against the black community. This further reveals how deeply the trial was underpinned&nbsp;by America's racial tensions.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKymZH9xfZVoZ2xnYG58cnyMrZ%2Bippeoerix1Z5kpZ2Rp7u1ecWrpqZlp5bBpLTIp55mrJiaerGxzqmjnmWmYryredKipKmrn6N8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
