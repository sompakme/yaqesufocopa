Cryer’s appearance will coincide with Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) and Karen Walker’s (Megan Mullally) storyline; the episode’s date has not yet been announced.</p><p>Since his long-running CBS comedy wrapped in 2015, Cryer has made guest appearances on several TV series, including on CBS’&nbsp;NCIS and Netflix’s Lady Dynamite (as himself) and The Ranch, which stars former Two and a Half Men co-star Ashton Kutcher. He will next be seen on the big screen in indie comedy Big Time Adolescence.</p><p>Cryer is the latest in a string of guest players that have already been announced for season two of the revival, which is technically season 10 overall.&nbsp;<a href=#>David Schwimmer will appear in a recurring role</a> as a love interest for Grace Adler (Debra Messing), marking the Friends star’s return to the network’s former “Must-See TV” Thursday night block. Alec Baldwin will be reprising his role as Karen’s on-and-off lover, Malcolm Widmark, and&nbsp;Mary McCormack will return as Grace’s older sister, Janet Adler. Chelsea Handler will also guest star.</p><p>The first season of the Will & Grace revival left best pals and roommates Grace and Will Truman (Eric McCormack) in existential crisis over the engagement of their parents, played by Robert Klein and Blythe Danner. Jack got engaged and Karen called off her long-term affair with Malcolm (Baldwin) to focus on her marriage, though&nbsp;<a href=#>Mullally recently told THR</a> that Karen will be divorcing her never-seen husband when the show returns.</p><p>Will & Grace nabbed <a href=#>five Emmy nominations</a> for its revival season, including best supporting actress for Mullally. The comedy from co-creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick returns with 18 episodes on Oct. 4 and has already been renewed for an 18-episode third season.</p><p>When eyeing plans for season two, Mutchnick spoke about the revolving door of guest stars who come through the comedy and their potential to join the Will & Grace family. “Once they’re on the show and when they fit in as well as they do, we hope to see these people over and over again because we feel like the audience likes it as much as we do,” <a href=#>he told THR.</a></p><p>Cryer, who earned two Emmys for his work on Two and a Half Men, is repped by UTA, Forward Entertainment and David Fox.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo6anZZOnxqa%2BjKCsnqukYsC1rdGroKefXay2rbiMoKmam5VifnJ%2FlHJqamc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
