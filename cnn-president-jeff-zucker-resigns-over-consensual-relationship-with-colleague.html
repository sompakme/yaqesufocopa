CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker wasn't the subject of an investigation but he found himself at the forefront of his own scandal. Former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo was&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fired by Zucker</a> months ago amid allegations that Cuomo advised his brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, during the latter's sexual assault investigation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While investigating that controversy, it was uncovered that Zucker and&nbsp;his key lieutenant, Allison Gollust, had been involved in a romantic relationship.

"I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">required to disclose it</a> when it began but I didn't. I was wrong." He added, "As a result, I am resigning today."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">CNN reported that the news of Zucker's resignation shocked employees and that it was the former president's intention to help ease someone else into his position. However, others wanted him out as soon as possible.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Gollust hasn't been silent during this time and issued a statement of her own.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years. Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time.
