Pour goop into a mold, use a plastic scoop to slide it into the oven, and make rubbery bugs to throw in someone's hair. It was as safe as anything heated under a powerful light bulb could be, but decades ago there was much more risk involved.</p><p>1964's Thingmaker, which introduced Creepy Crawlers, was basically the same thing: you put goop in the mold, and made creepy, kooky, mysterious, spooky, and altogether ooky bugs and spiders. But unlike the safe, colorful, '90s version that spawned a Saturday morning cartoon, the Thingmaker cared naught for a child's safety or enjoyment. There wasn't a big, plastic scoop to easily slide the mold into the oven, but there were small metal tongs. You (very carefully) slid the mold into the metal oven, but it wasn't powered by light bulb. Instead, it was&nbsp;<a href=#>plugged right into the wall</a>. That made it almost as hot, if not hotter, than an actual oven. Once the bugs were done, you removed the metal molding tray from the metal oven, using metal tongs. Yes, there was a cooling tray, but that was still piping hot metal coming at you from all sides. And kids are careless at best, so it's no small wonder that, when they reinvented the Crawlers for '90s kids, safe spookiness became all the rage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlnJvb2eUlruosdGorKxlpKTGtHnEr5yrZaOkuaV5z66ZpaGTZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
