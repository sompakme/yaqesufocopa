Lewis has been compared to Watson for&nbsp;years&nbsp;now—since the first&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/travel/g30285088/harry-potter-filming-locations-to-visit/>Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;movie,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/harry-potter/>Harry Potter</a> and the Sorcerer's Stone, was released in 2001, in fact.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was approached by a couple of young girls at a post office and they called me Hermione," she tells MarieClaire.com of her first time being mistaken for her celebrity doppelgänger. "I didn't recognize the name, so I went home and looked it up. It was around the time the first&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;film was released."</p><p>Lewis' day job is as an instructional assistant, but the self-described "cosplayer, blogger, and Hufflepuff" (per her Instagram bio) has put her famous-looking face to work too and earns extra money on the side dressing up as some of Watson's most famous characters,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a8231/emma-watson-twitter-rebuttal/>Hermione Granger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a23377/beauty-and-the-beast-photos/>Belle from&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast</a>.</p><p>"I started in 2017 when I attended Indiana Comic Con, and I received a lot of positive feedback on my Hermione cosplay," Lewis says of her origins as a professional <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/emma-watson/>Emma Watson</a> (or at least Emma Watson character) impersonator. "A lot of people turned their heads and commented on how much I looked like Emma."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tWSqD395C7WwjaR2L4qhLX-1920-80.jpg><p>Lewis says the side hustle is perfect for her and actually felt inevitable in a lot of ways because she's always sought out ways to perform and dress up (her résumé also includes a stint performing as a circus clown, time as a "haunted attraction actor," and roles in school plays). When it comes to professional appearances, Lewis mostly works the convention circuit (she declined to specify&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;what it pays to look just like&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a34738630/emma-watson-boyfriend-leo-robinton/>Emma Watson</a>, but did say that convention organizers typically pay for her travel and hotel expenses and that she sells autographed cosplay prints at the events), but has also branched out to birthday parties, which is just adorable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QKxk8hh7URGhMwLyWr2TCg-1920-80.jpg><p>"A little girl said to me, 'I've never met a real life princess before!' and I wanted to cry," Lewis said of her first birthday party appearance as Watson's Belle from the 2017 live-action&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast. "So, I told her she's a princess too!"&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Meaning? Lewis doesn't just dress as Watson's most iconic, commonly-cosplayed characters like Hermione Granger and Belle. She's also done an impressive version of Sam from&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29087607/sad-romance-movies-netflix/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a>&nbsp;(and told us she's actually working on two additional looks from the movie—the dress Watson's character wears for the "Living Room Routine" dance and the character's&nbsp;Rocky Horror&nbsp;look).</p><p>She's also currently in the process of sewing (talk about dedication) Meg March's pink ballgown from&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a30353716/emma-watson-taylor-swift-copyright-battle-little-women/>Little Women</a>&nbsp;to add that character to her repertoire, too.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6HDbndQviE6vpiAmDq6r8D-1920-80.jpg><p>Of course, she also does those more classic cosplay characters—and does them perfectly, FWIW. Her go-to&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;costume is Belle's casual, small provincial town look:</p><p>But she also does a '20s-inspired take on the character sometimes:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tat5hX3M9dapUxLxayghEQ-1920-80.jpg><p>Her favorite character to play, however, is Hermione, and it shows; she has a range of the character's looks in her wardrobe. There's classic, ready-for-class Hermione:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxNs439br7gkvoH6M4fi8k-1920-80.jpg><p>There's the more casual, hanging-in-the-common-room Hermione look:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AygKwr5rQxASvXGNqprGDB-1920-80.jpg><p>And, of course, Yule Ball Hermione, for when you're feeling fancy and/or festive:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nvi2wDgjuKAEgU4SPbQprK-1920-80.jpg><p>To see more of Lewis' impressive Emma Watson cosplays (and general doppelgänger-ness), follow her on&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/kariellex/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Instagram</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@kariellex?enter_from=pc&source=h5_m" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>TikTok</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZY2p9eYCPbGdonZ2irm7DwK2qqKZdmbyxvMSlnpqml5q%2FbrjOqKKapJmgsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
