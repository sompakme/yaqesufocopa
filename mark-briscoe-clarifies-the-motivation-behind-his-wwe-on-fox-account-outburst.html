Briscoe, who tragically lost his brother Jay Briscoe earlier this year, is known for his no-nonsense attitude both in and out of the ring.</p><p>If you haven’t been following the complete story, the WWE On FOX posted a picture of Bobby Lashley with Street Profits, accompanied by the catchphrase “DEM BOYZ!” – a phrase made famous by the Briscoe Brothers themselves during their illustrious career in Ring of Honor. The move didn’t sit well with Mark Briscoe, who took to social media to express his discontent.</p><p>“For real?? This sh*t is hilarious. Triple H, whoever runs this Twitter should probably be fired for lack of knowledge. Or they need the taste slapped out of their mouth for lack of reverence,” Briscoe tweeted, directly tagging Triple H.</p><p><a href=#>Briscoe later elaborated</a> on his feelings with an update on his Twitter account, where he confessed, “Oh yea, thatsss why I quit posting on Twitter lol. Just logged back on…woww. Some of y’all are wild lol. I just miss my brother, that’s all, and I got a little in my feelings when I seen the Fox post. @tripleh, you ain’t gotta fire nobody, times is tough. Love y’all..take it light people.”</p><p>As of now, there has been no response from either Triple H or the WWE on FOX handle regarding the controversy, leaving fans and fellow wrestlers wondering if the post was indeed in poor taste.</p><p>Mark and Jay Briscoe, who began their wrestling journey in 2000, had a remarkable career that spanned over two decades. They made their mark in promotions such as the East Coast Wrestling Association, Combat Zone Wrestling, Jersey All-Pro Wrestling, and of course, Ring of Honor, where they became 13-time ROH World Tag Team Champions – a record that speaks volumes about their legacy.</p><p>Their last match took place on December 10, 2022, when they faced off against FTR in AEW. The wrestling world continues to mourn the loss of Jay Briscoe, and Mark’s recent outburst shows just how deeply he still feels the absence of his brother.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Do you believe the WWE on FOX post crossed the line?
