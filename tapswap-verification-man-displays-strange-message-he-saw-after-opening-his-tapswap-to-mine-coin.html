Technically, this is when bot traffic infests a server. Bot traffic are non-human and they eat up resources. So what they did is to make everyone from that region to verify that they are human.

Some of which includes clicker apps and software. These are non-human activity, hence that verification would stop them from being able to use the apps. Even if it works, from time to time it will ask them to verify which ultimately stops the smooth running of their auto-clicker bots and apps."<h2>Man buys AC with money earned from Notcoin</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, a Nigerian youth happily showcased <a href=#>the air conditioner he purchased</a> thanks to earnings from Notcoin.</p><p class=align-left>He posed with the AC and urged crypto enthusiasts to keep tapping in order to take advantage of Tapswap mining.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGllboFyfZBmq5qoo6yusXnVnqminpmYrrW1zqdkppmeYrGqv8%2BlmLKrXajBs63NoJxmpZWowKKzxGamqZ2enruoedOap6yvkaV8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
