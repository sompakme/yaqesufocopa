"<i>Everybody was calling me Mr Flag Man.</i>"</p><p>Photo: Al Jazeera"></p><p>He designed the flag in October 1959, a year before Nigeria gained independence. He was paid&nbsp;– 100 pounds, equal to $ 281 in 1959.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>UW Staffer Creates New African Union Flag</p><p>The 79-year-old Akinkunmi now lives in one of the poorest areas of Ibadan. His house painted in colours of Nigerian flag is a distinctive feature in the area and it can only be reached by foot. However, Akinkunmi doesn’t have a car. He doesn't even have a phone. He lives separated from his wife for two decades after his health started deteriorating and now his only companion is his 28-year-old son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5e5ujj9epfc.jpg><p>His health is so poor now that he can’t even remember what his age is. He is unable to remember what he was doing on October 1, 1960 when the flag was hoisted for the first time in history. "<i>Well, I was just pleased,</i>" is the only thing that Akinkunmi can recount.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony Was Marked By Wrong Flag Incident</p><p>After Akinkunmi was forced to retire from civil service in 1993 due to his progressive illness, his pension payments were so irregular that he could not even feed himself.

He says that when he first saw his state he burst in tears.</p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p>However, Sunday also says that despite Akinkunmi’s terrible living conditions, he never heard anything negative from the old man. "<i>He would only say 'God bless Nigeria,' or 'Nigeria is moving forward and will keep moving forward'</i>”, Olaniran says. He also remembers that when he appealed to the press even the journalists couldn’t believe first that Akinkunmi was&nbsp;still alive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7vc94s42e63.jpg><p>In 2008 Akinkunmi&nbsp;was given a cheque of&nbsp;two million naira as fee for his appearance on a&nbsp;TV show.
