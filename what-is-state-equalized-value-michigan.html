data-sourcepos=3:1-3:89><span>Ever looked at your property tax bill in Michigan and felt like you needed a decoder ring to understand half the jargon?</span><span> You're not alone!</span><span> Today,</span><span> we're tackling the mysterious beast known as </span><strong>State Equalized Value (SEV)</strong><span>.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:46>SEV: Not Your Average Value Village Find</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:140><span>SEV isn't some dusty antique you stumbled upon at a yard sale.</span><span> It's actually a pretty important number when it comes to figuring out how much you owe in property taxes.</span><span> But unlike that porcelain cat collection you </span>think<span> might be valuable,</span><span> SEV is a specific calculation.</span><span> Here's the lowdown:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-11:0><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:188><strong>SEV in a Nutshell:</strong><span> It's essentially </span><strong>half of your property's true market value</strong><span>.</span><span> Basically,</span><span> imagine someone is buying your house.</span><span> The SEV is what they'd expect to pay,</span><span> on average.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=10:1-11:0><strong>The Equalization Equation:</strong><span> But wait,</span><span> there's more!</span><span> Local assessors set the initial value,</span><span> but then the county and state get involved in a process called </span><strong>equalization</strong><span>.</span><span> They make sure all properties across Michigan are valued fairly,</span><span> kind of like making sure everyone uses the same measuring cup when baking cookies for the neighborhood potluck.</span></li></ul><h3 data-sourcepos=12:1-12:46>SEV vs Taxable Value: The Tax Bill Tango</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:41><span>So,</span><span> SEV is important,</span><span> but it's not the final answer for your tax bill.</span><span> Here's where things get a little fancy:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=16:1-18:0><li data-sourcepos=16:1-16:225><strong>Enter the Taxable Value:</strong><span> This is the lower of two numbers:</span><span> SEV or your </span><strong>capped value</strong><span>.</span><span> The capped value is like a slow clap for inflation – it increases by a maximum of 5% or the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each year.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=17:1-18:0><strong>The Millage Rate Makes its Move:</strong><span> Now,</span><span> take your taxable value and multiply it by the </span><strong>millage rate</strong><span>.</span><span> The millage rate is basically a tax rate set by your local township,</span><span> school district,</span><span> and other entities.</span><span> This gets you the amount of property tax you owe.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:36><strong>Remember:</strong><span> Even though SEV plays a role,</span><span> it's the taxable value that directly impacts your tax bill.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=21:1-21:33>SEV: Not So Scary After All</h3><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:53><span>Understanding SEV might not make property taxes your new favorite
