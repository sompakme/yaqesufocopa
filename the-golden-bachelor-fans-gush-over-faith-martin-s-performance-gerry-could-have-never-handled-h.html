Kind of fun to whip it out in the Acoustic Duo! Haha.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The comments section proved that Faith Martin’s followers are very impressed with her vocals. But it was this comment about Gerry Turner that caught our eye and it looks like plenty are in agreement too.</p><p>It said, “Gerry could have never handled her.”</p><p>Someone replied to it and agreed, writing, “Never!” followed by a heart-eyes emoji.</p><p>Yet another chimed in, also in agreement, writing, “My thoughts exactly” with a smiley face emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/faith-comments-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gerry-and-theresa-have-reunited-in-new-jersey-after-the-golden-bachelor-wedding>Gerry and Theresa have reunited in New Jersey after The Golden Bachelor wedding</h2><p>Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist’s wedding was a huge hit with several The Golden Bachelor cast members (and quite a few from Bachelor Nation) in attendance.</p><p>It didn’t quite go down without a hitch, with Theresa having an issue with her dress and Susan Noles having a hard time getting the rings untied during the ceremony but that was all minor and the event was gorgeous.</p><p><a href=#>Faith Martin was there </a>along with Leslie Fhima, Kathy Swarts, and several other familiar faces.</p><p>After the big day was over, Gerry headed back to Indiana and Theresa went to New Jersey.</p><p>It took a few days for them to reunite but Gerry recently revealed that <a href=#>he made the long drive from Indiana to New Jersey</a> to be with Theresa in Shewsbury.</p><p>It looks like they may be staying there too. After initially talking about a move to South Carolina, Gerry revealed right before their wedding that he’s starting to fall in love with New Jersey and may just settle in with Theresa in her home state.</p><p>The Golden Bachelor is currently on hiatus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sdsm6zzqWbnqZdl66ktMSlpqtllpa7tHnGrqqhZZ%2BrsrN5xZqgraBdoq6zwMinqmaolaezsL7MmqWcnV2csrO%2B2GaaqK2cmXqprdWeZKedppq%2FbrTAp5ulnZRitaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
