These aren’t definitive.</p><p><strong>Flared nostrils</strong></p><p>Look at nostril movement people!</p><p>Flared nostrils can be a strong indicator that your date may be sexually attracted to you.</p><p><strong>Dilated pupils</strong></p><p>A persons' eyes can tell all...</p><p>It has been shown that dilated pupils can be caused by the surge of dopamine that you get when you’re attracted to someone.</p><p><strong>Eye contact</strong></p><p>Eye contact is important, so make sure you look directly into your dates' eyes.</p><p>If your date maintains eye contact, not only could they be attracted to you, but it’s likely they’re being sincere and really listening to what you're saying.</p><p><strong>Space</strong></p><p>Is your date sitting close to you?</p><p>If your date seems to be leaning in close, it shows they’re interested in you and they’re engaged in the conversation.</p><p>On the other hand, if the person seems to be keeping their distance, they aren’t necessarily not attracted to you.</p><p>First dates can be daunting and physical distance could just be nerves or shyness.</p><p><strong>Smiling</strong></p><p>It's always nice to smile, right?</p><p>A smile can go a long way, but can also induce the release of dopamine in someone else’s brain.</p><p>Facial expressions often display someone's true emotions towards you, so take a smile as a good sign.</p><p><strong>Scrambling words</strong></p><p>Is your date fumbling their words?</p><p>There is a good chance that if your date is lost for words, they might be anxious or nervous.</p><p>People can become tongue-tied when they find someone attractive.</p><p><strong>Feet position</strong></p><p>Look at their feet!</p><p>Who would have thought your date’s toes could be so telling of their attraction towards you?</p><p>Well, if you notice that their feet are pointing inwards then you know they like you.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000658091655.jpg><p>Meanwhile, the seven issues which could be destroying your relationship… and why being a ‘bubble couple’ spells doom.</p><p>Also, a woman was called a ‘disgusting fat pig’ who was good for ‘one f**k’ when she turned a bloke down on Tinder – so she got him fired.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman braves Hurricane Ida for FIRST DATE in hopes of finding love in a storm and leaves TikTok in stitches</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme5Jvam1rYmt8o7vDsmSlmZ6cwqKzxGacsaiVp8FuvsSam2axn6q%2Fbq%2FRrqqhZZ2eu6V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
