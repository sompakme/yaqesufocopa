Whether it’s visiting the graves of silent film star Rudolph Valentino or participating in the funeral procession for Princess Diana, these moments serve as a way for admirers to pay their respects. Even the stars of “The Andy Griffith Show” have become destinations for fans wanting to make a final tribute.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>As the years passed since the show’s finale in 1968, the main cast dwindled, and many of their graves became sacred ground for long-time fans. Be it Don Knotts’ final resting place in Westwood Memorial Park or George “Goober” Lindsey’s monument at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Jaspar, Alabama, fans found solace in paying homage (according to FindAGrave.com).</p><p>However, for those seeking to visit the grave of the show’s star, Andy Griffith, disappointment awaits.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Griffith’s Secret Resting Place:</strong></h3><p>When Andy Griffith passed away on July 3, 2012, he was laid to rest before the media could catch wind of his death. Reports state that the actor succumbed to an undisclosed illness around 7:00 a.m. at his Roanoke Island home in North Carolina. Griffith’s final wish, including his burial location, was pre-planned, according to a funeral home representative who spoke with CNN. The actor was buried on his family’s property on Roanoke Island, away from the public eye.</p><p>Larry F. Stegall, executive director of North Carolina’s Funeral Directors Association, expressed that the family’s decision was rare but emphasized the importance of honoring such wishes. This unconventional approach, with a swift burial following Griffith’s demise, prevented many loved ones from partaking in traditional post-death respects. Stegall noted, “I don’t recall having heard of it, and I’ve been here 32 years.”</p><h3><strong>Cindi’s Statement and Griffith’s Private Life:</strong></h3><p>In the aftermath of Griffith’s passing, his wife Cindi released a statement to the media, emphasizing his strong Christian faith. She indicated that Andy was prepared for the day he would be called home to his Lord. Notably, there were no mentions of any public or private service in her statements.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Outsider reports that the TV star’s final resting place is situated in a private cemetery on the family’s property, restricting traditional visits from fans. Griffith led a private life, and speculations suggest that he may have preferred avoiding the fuss associated with a more public burial.</p><h3><strong>Alternatives for Respects:</strong></h3><p>While visiting Andy Griffith’s gravesite may remain an unfulfilled wish for fans, there are alternative ways to pay respects. A bronze statue of Griffith was erected in his hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina, in October 200This 800-pound statue immortalizes Griffith’s character from “The Andy Griffith Show” alongside a smaller statue of his TV son, Opie Taylor.</p><p>During the statue’s unveiling, Griffith humorously remarked, “That beats anything. I kind of wish I looked like that now.” Though fans may not visit his gravesite, this statue stands as a lasting tribute to the beloved actor.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The mystery surrounding Andy Griffith’s gravesite adds a unique chapter to the legacy of a beloved TV star. While his resting place remains undisclosed and inaccessible to fans, alternative avenues, such as the Mount Airy statue, provide opportunities to honor and remember the iconic actor.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>16</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxyfY6tn55lopqutLvNZrCorV2Yrq%2FAjK%2BgrKGkYq6vsNhmnquhlpu2tbTSZp6rmaaawKrAxGefraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
