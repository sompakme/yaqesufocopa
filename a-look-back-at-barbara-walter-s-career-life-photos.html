She was truly a modern-day icon, and hero for working women. She once said, “This is what I tell, especially young women, fight the big fights. Don’t fight the little fight… Be the first one in, be the last one out. Do your <a href=# rel=noopener>homework</a>, choose your battles. Don’t whine, and don’t be the one who complains about everything. Fight the big fight.”</p><p>Sadly, on Dec 30, 2022, Walters passed away at the age of 93 in her Manhattan home. To honor her groundbreaking career and life, let’s take a look back. From her turbulent beginnings to her incredibly private life behind the camera, <a href=# rel=noopener>her iconic interviews</a> to trailblazing journalism work, her career and life were something extraordinary.</p><p>Check out Walters’ career and life in these photos below!</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.444365192582><h2>Early Life for Barbara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brooke-Shields-2022-New-York-Academy-Of-Art.jpg><p>Born on Sept 25, 1929, in Boston, Barbara Walters was the eldest child of Dena and Lou Walters. She had two younger siblings named Jacqueline, who passed in 1985, and a brother named Burton, who died of pneumonia in 1932. Life was turbulent for Barbara Walters, considering her father gained and lost their money rapidly throughout her childhood. Growing up, she lived in <a href=#>Boston</a>, Miami Beach, and later New York City, where she was surrounding by celebrities (which helped her interviewing stars later!)</p><p>In the early 1950s, she received her bachelors in English from Sarah Lawrence College.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Career Beginnings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/barbara-walters-life-photos-5.jpg><p>Walters first hit the scene in the early 1960s, when she was a writer and segment producer of “women’s interest stories” on The Today Show, after years of working as a publicist with Tex McCrary Inc and writer at Redbook magazine.

Quaaludes were all over the place. Valium. And the drugs numbed all the other feelings. But it didn’t take away the issues that I had. They got bigger and bigger. I was more and more isolated from my mom’s world. And I thought running would solve all my problems.”</p><p>The two had a complicated relationship, especially with Jackie keeping far away from the spotlight.
