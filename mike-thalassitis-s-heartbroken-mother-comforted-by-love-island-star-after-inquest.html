Montana, a close friend of the late star, had said Mike had been in a "dark place" in the months before his death.

She also said: "At the back of the diary was a number of notes that had been addressed to his family."

But I think it's important to let his memory live on and remember the importance of why this happened, and to change your own life on what terrible, terrible thing has happened to Mike."
