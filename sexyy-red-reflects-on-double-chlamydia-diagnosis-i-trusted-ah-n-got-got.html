During her recent appearance on Angela Yee's Lip Service podcast to promote her new album, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Sexyy Red</a> did her part to destigmatize sexual health by confessing that she was previously diagnosed with Chlamydia on two separate occasions.

After seeing some of the discourse, she dropped by @theneighborhoodtalk's comment section to share a message with the world. "OH SHUT UP I TRUSTED AH ü•∑üèæ & GOT GOT ITS LIFE üíØüôèüèæ I‚Äôm goodt nie shidddd," she promised readers.</p><p>Have you checked out Sexyy Red's Hood Hottest Princess album yet?
