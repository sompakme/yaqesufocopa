Moreover, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diplo</a> just released his new single "Heartbroken" featuring <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Polo G</a> and Jessie Murph, complete with its own music video, as well. While that lineup suggests that the EDM-centered producer, the Chicago MC, and the TikTok star cooked up a dance bop, they actually crafted a country-leaning ballad. For those who were expecting the former, we still suggest you give this track a listen, as you might find treasure regardless. With tender acoustic guitars, atmospheric background vocals, and faint synth pads, this is a chilled-out but melancholy tune.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the production and vocal chorus melody is what pulls "Heartbroken" to that country side. The relatively slow-tempo composition lends itself well to tales of, to put it frankly, heartbreak. However, it takes a different context as the song goes on, because it's actually about how a partner helps another get through those emotions. Soft piano chords also accentuate the melodrama in the song in a compelling way, making it sound a bit more full and dynamic. Maybe we'll see these artist tap back into this sonic pallet another time, and with Polo G <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">recently dropping a freestyle</a>, perhaps he's gearing up to more releases soon.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diplo-s-heartbroken-with-polo-g-jessie-murph-watch-the-music-video>Diplo's "Heartbroken" With Polo G & Jessie Murph: Watch The Music Video</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the 24-year-old rapper is also getting more involved with his label, Only Dreamers Achieve. Recently, he revealed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the surprising story</a> behind one of his recent signees, CNN Mikey. With more curation and leadership surely on the way from Polo, whether from a music release or label management standpoint, let this track relax you before more heat is on the way.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboR2g49mm6KonKR6qbHAq6ubqp%2Bgsq95z6ijqGWXYremv9KinGalpae9qXnSramemZ1iura%2FyJxkr6GUmrw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
