It's not "blond" or "brunette," and it's not even models, although it does seem that's a stipulation for the actor when it comes to women he dates.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>No, it seems like DiCaprio is capping the age of his girlfriends to 25 years old, no matter how old he is. Since becoming a teenage heartthrob in the '90s thanks to hits like "Titanic" and "Romeo + Juliet," <a href=#>DiCaprio has a long relationship history</a> with several women in the industry. Back in August of 2022, DiCaprio broke things off with his then-girlfriend, Camila Morrone, just <a href=#>months after the model turned 25</a>. As this popular <a href=#>Reddit</a> graphic details, DiCaprio's age keeps increasing, but his girlfriends never go past the age of 25.</p><p>Months after his breakup, DiCaprio is being linked to 19-year-old model Eden Polani, who is one of his youngest partners to date. According to <a href=#>The Jewish Chronicle</a>, the rumors between DiCaprio and Polani started when they were seen together at a party in Los Angeles late January. While some sources are now saying it's not true, per <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the rumored romance sparked comparisons to other people who'd have a 29-year age gap if they theoretically dated, like "Stranger Things"'s David Harbour and Millie Bobby Brown, according to <a href=#>BuzzFeed</a>. In that vein (and all in good fun of course), here are eight women who are currently older than DiCaprio's rumored girlfriend.</p><h2>Sadie Sink, 20 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/sadie-sink-20-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Michael Kovac/Getty Images</span><p>Even though Sadie Sink appeared in Taylor Swift's short film "All Too Well," coincidentally as a young girl dating a much older man (played by Dylan O'Brien), don't expect life to imitate art here. However, with Sink turning 20 back in April, per <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a>, she is definitely older than 19-year-old Eden Polani. This example is one of the more shocking women included in the list since many people have seen Sink play a teen for so long that the idea of her dating a 48-year-old is beyond wild. But then again ... That's the point.</p><h2>Greta Thunberg, 20 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/greta-thunberg-20-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Per Grunditz/Shutterstock</span><p dir=ltr>Swedish native and prominent climate change activist Greta Thunberg just celebrated her 20th birthday this past January, according to <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a>. This makes her just slightly older than Eden Polani. Thunberg's fierce work regarding global warming and the environment has granted her worldwide fame. And with her <a href=#>scorching takedown of Andrew Tate</a> that allegedly led to his arrest in Romania, Thunberg has shown she is not to be trifled with. A lot of the conversation around DiCaprio and his growing age gap with his partners has to do with their lack of compatibility â€” what does a nearly 50-year-old man talk about with a 19 year old? And while Thunberg and DiCaprio share a passion for saving the planet, do not expect Thunberg to be on DiCaprio's arm anytime soon.</p><h2>Jenna Ortega, 20 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/jenna-ortega-20-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Amy Sussman/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr>Fresh off her major success with Netflix's "Wednesday" and with the hype of her upcoming new "Scream VI" movie, Jenna Ortega is one of the most popular actors out there right now. And as <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a> reports, Ortega is a Libra born in 2002. Another child star, Ortega has been on television screens since she appeared on "Jane the Virgin" at age 12 and then starred in Disney Channel's "Stuck in the Middle" at 14. Ortega has been outspoken about rumors about her dating life being false, according to her episode on the <a href=#>"Just Between Us"</a> podcast hosted by Bailee Madison and Kaitlin Vilasuso. So if she ever does date anyone, it'll come from the "You" alum's mouth (and it most definitely won't be Leo DiCaprio).</p><h2>Billie Eilish, 21 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/billie-eilish-21-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Vivien Killilea/Getty Images</span><p>Billie Eilish has been killing it as a musician since she was 13 and made her way into mainstream pop culture consciousness at age 15. <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a> says the "Ocean Eyes" singer just turned 21 in December. Despite her young age, Eilish has been public about the fact that she's dating The Neighborhood frontman, Jesse Rutherford, since right before her 21st birthday. And as she told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, she's happy and doesn't seem bothered by the critiques of their 11-year-age gap (he's 31). So we're not saying Leo&nbsp;DiCaprio has a chance, but it might be best to keep Eilish away from DiCaprio at all costs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Chloe Lukasiak, 21 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/chloe-lukasiak-21-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr>A fan favorite on the mega-popular Lifetime reality TV series, "Dance Moms," Chloe Lukasiak has been in the limelight since she was nine years old, according to <a href=#>Insider</a>. Now, the former competitive dancer is 21 years old, with her birthday on May 25, 2001, per <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a>. Lukasiak has been in a few movies and appeared on several talk shows and series as herself, but she now has a popular YouTube channel and continues to be herself on social media. And don't worry, she's taken; she and skater/influencer Brooklinn "Brook" Khoury confirmed their relationship in 2021 (per <a href=#>People</a>) and are still going strong.</p><h2>Maddie Ziegler, 20 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/maddie-ziegler-20-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Presley Ann/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr>The fact that a lot of the "Dance Mom" girls are older than DiCaprio's rumored girlfriend, Polani, just makes the age gap all the more real. Maddie Ziegler, Abby Lee Miller's star performer on the series, is currently 20 years old with a birthday of Sept. 30, 2002, per <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a>. Ziegler has had a long and well-known creative and familial relationship with Sia. The young star also recently starred with Jenna Ortega in HBO's school shooter drama, "The Fallout."</p><p dir=ltr>If you were an avid watcher of the Lifetime series in its heyday, it's hard to imagine those girls dating Leo DiCaprio. Yes, they're forever children in our minds because we watched them as little children getting yelled at by Abby, but still, it's really jarring when you put it into perspective like that.</p><h2>Skai Jackson, 20 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/skai-jackson-20-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>David Livingston/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr>Famous for playing the sassy and fabulous Zuri Ross on Disney Channel's "Jessie" and subsequent spin-offs, Skai Jackson is an internet icon. Outside of her long filmography, Jackson is also known for the <a href=#>meme</a> that uses a picture of her sitting pretty. Basically, Jackson has spent a long time in the spotlight, and she's only 20 years old, according to <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a>. Being famous since an early age does make Jackson an expert in how to handle drama and online feuds, as <a href=#>J-14</a> recalls with her potential feud with much-older co-star Debby Ryan. So it seems like Jackson would be able to curb any advances from DiCaprio if she wanted to.</p><h2>Emma Chamberlain, 21 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/8-young-stars-older-than-leonardo-dicaprios-rumored-new-girlfriend/emma-chamberlain-21-years-old-1675807097.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr>Lastly, we have a YouTube icon, Emma Chamberlain. Not many can go from having a viral and hit YouTube channel to being the face of Louis Vuitton and now Cartier. But Chamberlain can. She started her YouTube in 2016 and since then has made a name for herself outside of the social media space, hosting <a href=#>Vogue's red carpet for the Met Gala</a> two years in a row and having an enviously cool house, per <a href=#>Architectural Digest's YouTube</a>. According to <a href=#>Famous Birthdays</a>, Chamberlain is 21 years old with her birthday being May 22, 2001, and she's in a long-term relationship with singer Role Model, per <a href=#>J-14</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpZ312gI5xZLKnpaO0br%2FTmqmsZZ%2Bhsaa%2BjK2fmqZdobKwusCrm6hllJ6worzRoqasZaKqurC%2BxJ1kp52nYrSqvsufqaKdnpl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
