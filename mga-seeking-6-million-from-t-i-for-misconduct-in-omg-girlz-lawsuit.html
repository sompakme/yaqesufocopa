The pair had claimed that the company used the likeness of a teen pop girl group created by Tiny in 2009, the OMG Girlz, as inspiration for their popular doll collection. Tiny called the verdict "horrible" following the news.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, MGA is firing back. The company's lawyers claim the lawsuit was handled improperly, and they are looking to be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reimbursed for hefty legal fees</a>. “The OMG Girlz’ litigation tactics, over-reaching claims, and misconduct — including violating one of this Court’s … rulings as to require a mistrial — justify awarding MGA the over $6.1million in fees spent litigating this matter,” the lawyers wrote.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-t-i-and-tiny-sued-mga-entertainment>T.I.

Surprise OMG Girls” dolls after the group. “The animated OMG Dolls copy the OMG Girl distinctive physical appearance, hair styles and hair colors, dress and mimic the OMG Girl released sound recordings,” T.I. and Tiny's lawsuit against MGA read. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The couple</a> also accused the company of racism, attempting to convince a jury that the dolls showcase “cultural appropriation and outright theft of the intellectual property.” MGA's legal team claimed the trial was unfair due to these racism accusations, and it was later ruled a mistrial. MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Isaac Larian, said that he "feels great" following the verdict.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
