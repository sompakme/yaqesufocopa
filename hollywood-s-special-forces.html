A veritable documentary on the service's tactics, the final battle resembles the real-life SAS assault on the Iranian embassy in London two years earlier.</p><p>The SAS would return in the 1999 BBC telefilm&nbsp;Bravo Two Zero, which starred <strong>Sean Bean</strong> (Game of Thrones) in the true-life tale of a British soldier captured behind enemy lines during the first Gulf War.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>“The Delta Force” (1986)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-12-2011-a-l.jpg><p>Martial arts star <strong>Chuck Norris</strong> (along with co-star <strong>Lee Marvin</strong>) gets into the special-ops game in this Cannon film actioner about a Delta Force team battling Lebanese terrorists who hijack an American airliner.

Whether mowing down the thugs who kidnapped his daughter (in&nbsp;Commando, 1985) or going low-tech against a mysterious alien monster (Predator), the characters played by '80s strongman&nbsp;<strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger&nbsp;</strong>came ready-made with skills that kill.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar vein, last year's The&nbsp;A-Team, starring <strong>Liam Neeson</strong>, rebooted the '80s action TV series about a group of former Army special forces soldiers turned mercenaries ("A-Team" is a Green Beret term).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>“Navy Seals” (1990)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-13-2011-a-l.jpg><p>Everyone's favorite winner <strong>Charlie Sheen</strong> stars as a Navy SEAL battling terrorists who have kidnapped Navy personnel and stolen Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, taking them from the high seas to the battlegrounds of Beirut.

Back in Washington, Clancy hero Jack Ryan (<strong>Harrison Ford</strong>, pictured) uncovers the political machinations that started the operation — and which would end it with brutal "plausible deniability."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>“Executive Decision” (1996)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-1-2011-a-l.jpg><p>Perhaps more science fiction than real-life special forces, this boxoffice hit follows a crack unit that uses an experimental aircraft — a retrofitted Stealth fighter — to enter a hijacked airliner in flight to subdue terrorists. Team leader <strong>Steven Seagal</strong>&nbsp;(pictured) makes an early and unexpected exit, leaving the team to count on an intelligence analyst (<strong>Kurt Russell</strong>) and nerdy scientist (<strong>Oliver Platt</strong>) along for the ride.&nbsp;Seagal had previously played a former Navy SEAL trapped aboard a hijacked battleship in Under Siege (1992)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>“The Rock” (1996)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-4-2011-a-l.jpg><p>This kinetic actioner from director <strong>Michael Bay</strong> and producer <strong>Jerry Bruckheimer</strong> includes a range of special forces characters, including a rogue unit of Force Recon Marines led by <strong>Ed Harris</strong> who take over Alcatraz to blackmail the government. Scientist <strong>Nic Cage</strong> is recruited to accompany a Navy SEAL team to infiltrate the island along with <strong>Sean Connery</strong>, a criminal with his own special forces resume and skills (and a wink to Connery's 007 days).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>“Black Hawk Down” (2001)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-7-2011-a-l.jpg><p>Director <strong>Ridley Scott'</strong>s riveting and highly realistic portrayal of the ill-fated 1993 Battle of Mogadishu stars an ensemble cast topped by <strong>Josh Hartnett</strong>, <strong>Ewan McGregor</strong> and <strong>Eric Bana</strong>. The film portrays many special forces units, including Navy SEALs, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, Air Force Pararescue crews and Delta Force snipers, two of whom volunteered to defend a downed pilot against overwhelming odds, and who received posthumous Medals of Honor for their bravery.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>“Tears of the Sun” (2003)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-9-2011-a-l.jpg><p><strong>Bruce Willis</strong> stars as a Navy SEAL team leader sent into war-torn Nigeria to rescue an American citizen tending to refugees.

While the Duke's gung-ho patriotism and anti-Communist fervor perhaps got in the way of producing a coherent film,&nbsp;it was a commercial success. Featuring the popular Green Beret ballad from two years before, the movie would stand as almost the only pro-military film set in Vietnam for many years.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>James Bond</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/special-forces-gallery-8-2011-a-l.jpg><p>Ian Fleming's venerable spy was orginally from the British SIS — their version of the CIA — and while he's more of a one-man army, many of his assignments covered the same territory as his more heavily-armored allies, even if the fancy gadgets were sometimes pure sci-fi.&nbsp; In You Only Live Twice (1967), Bond teamed up with the ultimate Japanese special forces: ninjas.
