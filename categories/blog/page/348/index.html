Simple and universal (at least for those with manes long enough to be swept into a high-slung style), the high pony is polished, pretty, playful, and easily personalized with your favorite accessories. Plus, the updo comes with some appealing fringe benefits.&nbsp; “The beauty of a sleek ponytail is that it looks good on everyone,” says hairstylist&nbsp;Dimitris Giannetos, a favorite of Megan Fox and Joey King, who adds that the high and slicked pony is a practical, chic means of elevating an outfit while keeping your hair out of your face (and snatching it at the same time). <a href=../../../../how-to-nail-the-sleek-high-ponytail-look.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../ice-cube-s-greatest-acting-roles.html>Ice Cube's Greatest Acting Roles</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
