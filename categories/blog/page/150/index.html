The Two and a Half Men alum will be guest-starring as himself for one episode when the revival returns on NBC in the fall, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Cryer’s appearance will coincide with Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) and Karen Walker’s (Megan Mullally) storyline; the episode’s date has not yet been announced.
