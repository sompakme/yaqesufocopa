That said, there were many who didn’t like him back in the day and even Vince Russo didn’t have a good time with him. Goldberg was also alleged to have called his lawyer after refusing to job to Scott Steiner in WCW.</p><p>The WWE Hall of Famer is also known for the greatest streak in WCW, as his undefeated streak made him one of the biggest stars in the industry during the 90s. That doesn’t mean he was someone to work with.</p><p><a href=#>While speaking on the Kliq This podcast</a>, former WWE & WCW writer Vince Russo talked about his time working with Goldberg in World Championship Wrestling. Russo stated that Goldberg was the most difficult star to work with and claimed that Goldberg called his lawyer after refusing to job to Scott Steiner in WCW.</p><p>”The most difficult person for me to work with in all three companies, bro it was Goldberg. Because he just believed it. I’ll never forget bro, I needed Goldberg to do a job for Scott Steiner. Goldberg actually said to me, ‘Vince, if this were real, Scott Steiner would not beat me.’ And i said, ‘Okay Bill, he is right over there. You go tell Scott Steiner that. Go tell Scott that and see what Scott says.’</p><p>So bro, Brad Segal had to actually fly in Bill Goldberg and his attorney. Brad Segal, the head of TBS and TNT, had to fly them in to tell Goldberg you’re doing a job to Scott Steiner.”</p><p>Goldberg remains&nbsp;<a href=#>a free agent</a>&nbsp;after his WWE contract expired and it is not known whether he will ever get his retirement match. Regardless, many fans will agree that Goldberg wasn’t the best person to work with and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Vince Russo said?
