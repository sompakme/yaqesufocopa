Photo / Giphy</p><p>US television icon Oprah Winfrey was famous for her generous mid-show giveaways; now, a lucky fan has revealed what really happened when the cameras stopped rolling.</p><p>Taking to TikTok, Candi Davis - a woman who received diamond earrings, a luxury handbag and a brand-new car during one of Winfrey’s shows - has revealed what the talk show host said to her after her lucky win.</p><p>In the now-viral video which has received more than three million views, Davis said the beloved talk show host got candid with her prize recipients in 2010: “I was in the audience of the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show</i> in 2010, when she gave away Volkswagen Beetles for Christmas,” Davis said. “It was a crazy, crazy day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/VRMWUAmNWSheLXIJ2Tw6hM9oG8Q=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LYTCBQKIE5CPVHWDHZ6IH5QQ3U.jpg"><p>She explained that Winfrey “kicked off her gold high heels” and sat on the edge of the stage where she addressed the group of winners and said: “I know you don’t feel like you deserve any of this stuff, and you don’t.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“‘None of you deserve it,’” Winfrey allegedly said before continuing, “‘But you are worthy of it, and I want you to remember that.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/wfzTPPfxMNxFRXZtwBdW0MvFmtU=/16x27/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/3JXIBEEQBVEF3FYTT23FQUG2QM.png"><p>Despite Davis describing Winfrey’s post-win pep talk as “a beautiful moment”, many fans took offence to it and revealed their thoughts in the comment section. One person wrote: “‘None of you deserve it, but you’re worthy’ … kind of sounds like a backhanded compliment.”</p><p>Another person said “it’s [giving] backhanded compliment” to which Davis responded with: “It wasn’t meant to be. I just did not tell the story right.”</p><p>The backlash resulted in Davis posting a follow-up video where she explained that Winfrey’s comments were not to belittle the winners but rather uplift them.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“When the show was over, the audience was full of people just crying and very emotional about what we had all just experienced of being gifted the car.</p><p>“There were a lot of people saying, ‘I should sell my car and give the money to my kids.’</p><p>“Oprah overheard some of that talk and said, ‘Let me stop you right there. You don’t deserve this, and if you feel like you don’t deserve this, that’s valid.</p><p>“‘But I want you to feel worthy of it. I want you to accept it. I want you to leave here with the car and not feel bad. Release any guilt you feel about being gifted this car.’”</p><p>Davis ended the video saying: “She meant it in a really sweet way. It wasn’t a backhanded compliment.”</p><p>Another video posted on Davis’ account revealed she still has the car - that she got to choose the colour of - and kept it in mint condition.</p><p>She also said she was given a bunch of high-priced items during the giveaway including Le Creuset cookware, a burgundy Coach purse, sequinned Ugg boots and pear-drop diamond earrings that she has also held onto in the 12 years since her win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS8sb7AoWSwoZ6bv6bFjKCgr52RrK66edaipaedomK%2FpsLEmqOsZaedrrV50Z6YpaSpYrWivM%2Bepaxlkpq1qrrDZquhnV2osKa6xKxmj4uGfYSakayFhX%2BNiHinmIKxbYdwenKMf4Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
