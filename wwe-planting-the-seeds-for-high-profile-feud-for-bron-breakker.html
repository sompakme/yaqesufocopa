Despite his ongoing commitments in NXT, WWE has wasted no time in laying the groundwork for Breakker’s future as a major player in the company.</p><p><a href=#>In recent episode of Friday Night SmackDown,</a> Breakker sought guidance from Triple H regarding contract offers from RAW and SmackDown, signaling his readiness to transition to the grand stage of WWE’s main roster. However, an unexpected interruption by none other than Paul Heyman added an intriguing twist to the narrative.</p><p>According to insights from Dave Meltzer in the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Heyman’s impromptu interaction with Breakker was more than just a passing moment. It was a strategic move by WWE to plant the seeds for a future showdown between Breakker and none other than the Tribal Chief himself, Roman Reigns.</p><p>Heyman’s presence and the subsequent exchange with Breakker hinted at a potential feud brewing between the two formidable competitors down the line. With Reigns currently embroiled in high-profile storylines involving the likes of The Rock and Jacob Fatu, the prospect of a clash with Breakker adds another layer of intrigue to WWE’s future plans.</p><p>”It’s been noted with Heyman showing up in the Breakker segment on Smackdown and Breakker doing the “Best spear in the business” T-shirt and gimmick that this could be a subtle start for a program way down the line. Obviously Reigns has programs set up for Rock and Sikoa as well and he only does a few matches per year.”</p><p>Breakker’s bold claim of possessing the “Best spear in the business” further fuels anticipation for a showdown with Reigns, who is renowned for his devastating spear maneuver. As fans eagerly await the unfolding of this storyline, the possibility of witnessing Breakker and Reigns lock horns on the main roster is undeniably tantalizing.</p><p>The question remains: Are you ready to witness the collision of two titans in the squared circle?
