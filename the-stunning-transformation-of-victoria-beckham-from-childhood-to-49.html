The third <a href=#>Beckham child</a> was born in Madrid, Spain because David played for the local football club at the time, Real Madrid. Before the birth, the Beckhams had met Tom Cruise and, according to David, he loved the actor's last name. The idea stuck with him, and the couple decided to take the Spanish spelling of the word for baby No. 3's moniker.&nbsp;</p><p>Once he became a teen, Cruz took after his mother and became interested in <a href=#>music</a>, singing and taking guitar lessons. "The baton has gone over to him," Victoria told <a href=#>Vogue Australia</a>&nbsp;in 2022 of Cruz, in terms of being the musician in the family. Still, she had reservations about her third son trying to become a famous musician after her own experiences. "You want to offer your support and do what you can to help them. But it makes you a bit nervous because, you know ... you don't ever want anybody to be anything other than kind and love what your children do," Victoria explained.</p><p>On the professional side of things, a year after giving birth to Cruz, Victoria released her second book, titled "That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between." In the book, she revealed the secrets to her often-excellent fashion and beauty choices. Her popularity expanded beyond just the United Kingdom, as she sold the rights for the book to be sold in America, Europe, Japan, and China.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxiZ4ZxhI6sq66mnp67qHnTq5inq5akv66t06Kmp2WmnrC1u9GimGaalZi4qa3MZpqhoZyZtbC7w2arqGVkbnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
