My mum wants to go into every store to see it for herself.</p><p>“Who knew our idea, which was 3D printed from home, is now across 440 Priceline stores in Australia and Chemist Warehouse stores in NZ and used by Kendall Jenner! It’s so surreal!”</p><p><span class=h3><b>News.com.au tests out the Contour Cube</b></span></p><p>As someone who is only just getting into skincare in the last 12 months at the age of 27, I was keen to test out the Contour Cube to see if it would make a good addition to my regimen.</p><p>According to <i><a class=body-link href=# title=www.healthline.com>Heathline</a></i>, the benefits of an ice facial include eliminating puffiness, reducing swelling and oiliness, boost a skin’s glow and reduce signs of aging.</p><p>However, it is all anecdotal evidence with no definitive clinical research behind it.</p><p>People with issues such as thin or sensitive skin, or broken capillaries, are advised to avoid ice facials.</p><p>The tool seemed simple enough to use as someone relatively new to the game – all customers have to do is fill the container up to 90 per cent with water.</p><p>Then, one it’s frozen you just have to run it under water to start a bit of a defrosting process and rub it over your skin.</p><p>It was easy to use, although I made the mistake of over filling the packaging, so that is a lesson for next time as it made it a little hard to open the container.</p><p>The tool also helped me soothe my angry red marks I was experiencing thanks to breakouts.</p><p>I have seen people use things like green tea, or adding fruit such as cucumbers and blueberries to the mix. That is definitely something I’d be keen to try moving forward.</p><p>But, as a first step when it comes to skincare, after cleanser, it will now be a permanent addition to my routine.</p><p><span class=h3><b>The product’s origin</b></span></p><p>On how the idea came about, Sarah said it was about how awkward holding an ice cube in your hands was</p><p>“I realised how inconvenient, messy and awkward using tiny ice cubes are and it makes your hand so cold,” she <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=d7e279da2b3e5e9b53e813171cc929a0 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>told news.com.au in 2021</a>, just eight months after the company launched.</p><p>“I thought surely there is a tool that solves the problem but I found no tool for facial icing. So I put pen to paper and was drawing different designs on what I wanted the tool to look like as I’m a graphic designer by background.”</p><p>The Sydneysider was lucky her partner also owned a 3D printer.</p><p>“Once I was happy with the design it was crazy to have a prototype printed in a couple of hours and then have it in my hand,” she said.</p><p>“I created a little mould for my mum to test out the shape and she really loved it.”</p><p>Ms Forrai’s business, Contour Cube was born, and since then her one bedroom apartment has been turned into a beauty warehouse with around 2000 products sold since launch.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Her first video on TikTok reached 20,000 people and she said it was “crazy” to gain sales when “no one had seen the product before”.</p><p>But it was her third TikTok video which went “viral” on Valentine’s Day that saw the product completely sell out with half a million views. She made $20,000 in just two weeks.</p><p>Just three months after launching, the Contour Cube was also stocked in Urban Outfitters in the US.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8GemK6sqWSzoq%2FEZpmonKlkwLqwzZ6wZpqVlsK1xYypqaicpZjBbq%2FOp6uoraJisLauxGalqK9dlsOitcuamaWdXZbBbrzRopqepJmjsnC6xLCqZqukpL%2B6e5VtmW1taGavca%2BSbmmaa5OYs6Wxk29onpxjaYFysMCd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
