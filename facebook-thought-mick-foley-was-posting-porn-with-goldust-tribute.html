Pleasure is a very interesting phrase to use in this instance.</p><p><a href=#>We previously reported</a> that several WWE Superstars have already commented about how much they will miss Dustin Rhodes in WWE. He was a favorite and a veteran of the locker room.</p><p>Mick Foley had some classic moments with Goldy and he wanted to share a nice little picture on Facebook. However, there was an issue because the social media giant saw Mick Foley’s picture and thought it was porn.</p><p>Apparently, Foley got a notice back from Facebook when he tried to turn his touching tribute into an ad saying: “This ad isn’t running because it includes an image or video depicting people performing seductive or implied sexual acts (ie: removing clothing, provocative dancing, etc). This kind of material is sensitive in nature.”</p><p>Yes, Mick Foley was just trying to share a classic Mankind/Goldust moment and Goldy was licking Foley… but was it really porn?</p><p>This is just proof that everyone has their own thing and Facebook is doing their best to make sure that nobody is triggered in that department. So, thank you for protecting us from the Attitude Era, Facebook.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
