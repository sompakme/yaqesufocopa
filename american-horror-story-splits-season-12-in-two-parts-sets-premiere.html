With productions shut down amid the work stoppage from the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, FX has announced that AHS: Delicate, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>which had already been in production</a>, will release in two parts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Along with the announcement that Part One will premiere Sept. 20, FX released a first look at the headlining trio in the psychological horror story which, for the first time, is based on a novel: Danielle Valentine’s Delicate Condition. The novel, which released this month, is described as a gripping thriller about an actress (Roberts) who becomes convinced that a sinister figure is going to great lengths to make sure her pregnancy never happens. A cover blurb from author Andrea Bartz<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> described the story&nbsp;</a>as “the feminist update to&nbsp;Rosemary’s Baby&nbsp;we all needed.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Murphy previously told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> that the season’s sole writer and showrunner Halley Feiffer “has written a fun, stylish and ultimately terrifying role especially for Kim, and this season is ambitious and unlike anything we have ever done.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As for the story on which the season is based, Valentine previously told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>EW</a>: “It is essentially a horror novel about pregnancy. It’s a novel exploring not just the actual physical gruesomeness of what pregnancy is, but also the medical gaslighting that even modern, very privileged women experience as they’re going through their pregnancies and the symptoms that I feel we as a culture still don’t talk about for strange reasons.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Karadshian and Delevigne are both newcomers to AHS, while Roberts (who has starred on previous cycles Coven,&nbsp;Freak Show,&nbsp;Cult,&nbsp;Apocalypse&nbsp;and&nbsp;1984) makes her return after a four-year hiatus. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez (Pose) and franchise alum Zachary Quinto are also among the Delicate cast.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Murphy, Falchuk, Feiffer, Alexis Martin Woodall, Scott Robertson and John J. Gray are executive producers on AHS: Delicate, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;produced by 20th Television.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">AHS: Delicate is the latest series to adapt amid the ongoing writer and actor strikes. With an end to the work stoppage not yet in sight, THR reported how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>streamers have been debating</a> whether or not to hold onto completed series until after the labor strife is resolved and talent could promote the project. Amazon recently announced that Robert Kirkman’s animated series <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Invincible</a> would be split into two parts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, American Horror Stories, the AHS spinoff, will return with a four-episode Halloween event, releasing Oct. 26 on Hulu.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Part One of AHS: Delicate premieres Sept. 20 at 10 p.m. on FX and streams the next day on Hulu. The network has yet to confirm the episode count or when Part Two will release.
