ROME — Carlo Mazzacurati’s “The Right Distance” may not be the director’s best film, but is stronger and tighter than what he’s produced in the last decade. An inconsistent director, Mazzacurati does warm to making movies about marginalized characters without dipping too far into the syrupy posturing that passes as small-town nostalgia in much of today’s Italian cinema. Despite overreaching ambitions, word-of-mouth and positive local reviews could help boost figures as it carves out an arthouse niche for itself.</description></item><item><title>Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle: Latest weather tracking - dire warning of building damage, monster seas</title><link>/tropical-cyclone-gabrielle-latest-weather-tracking-dire-warning-of-building-damage-monster-seas.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tropical-cyclone-gabrielle-latest-weather-tracking-dire-warning-of-building-damage-monster-seas.html</guid><description>KEY POINTS

It is not recommended to combine a large number of different heads on a single zone, although people do this all of the time to water shrubs or flowers in existing zones.
As a result, is it possible to add a sprinkler head to an existing zone? To get from the new valve to the new sprinkler head positions, you’ll need to dig a trench. It is recommended that the trenches be 2 to 3 inches deeper than the usual depth of frozen ground in the region, or a minimum of 6 inches in depth.</description></item><item><title>French Montana Documentary Has Star-Studded Premiere</title><link>/french-montana-documentary-has-star-studded-premiere.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/french-montana-documentary-has-star-studded-premiere.html</guid><description>Today, Montana is one of the best-known rappers and the highest-streamed African-born artist of all time.
