Many took to Twitter after the episode ended to pay tribute to Hayley and how much she had brought to the show.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Talk about a <a href=#>@GeneralHospital</a> episode that was a tear jerker. Port Charles will never be the same without Kiki. You will be missed <a href=#>@HayleyErin</a></p><p>— Becky (@townmother) <a href=#>November 28, 2018</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=#>@HayleyErin</a> <a href=#>@GeneralHospital</a> I’m so sad to see Kiki killed. You more than made that part your own and I was looking forward to seeing her future. Yours looks incredibly bright with your new series. Best of luck, you and your character will be missed. xo</p><p>— Janie Miller (@RockOnAncientQn) <a href=#>November 28, 2018</a></p><p>Kiki’s death was also a huge shock for other characters on the show. When Griffin was asked to help Jordan (Briana Nicole Henry) confirm the woman in her bed was dead, his whole world was turned upside down.</p><p>The investigation and the fallout may haunt Port Charles for the foreseeable future.</p><p>As for what’s next for Hayley Erin, she will definitely be a part of Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists.&nbsp;Could she have more projects in the works? That’s certainly a possibility considering her previous tweet mentioning how “lots of secrets” were being kept.</p><p>For now, General Hospital fans are left to mourn Hayley Erin’s portrayal as Kiki Jerome. It looks like it will be an emotional few days in Port Charles, so make sure to watch with tissues nearby.</p><p></p><p>General Hospital airs weekdays on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWirn5a9tHvWobBmnJmZeqy1yqJkpZ2Rq7Jus8SnnKuZnGK1sL%2FPoquapF2dsrOx0mauoZmkYrWixcuesGadop67brXSZpuooZ6ceq%2B71mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
