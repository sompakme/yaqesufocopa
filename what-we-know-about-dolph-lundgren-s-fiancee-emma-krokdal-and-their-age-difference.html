"I just feel like Emma is very mature for her age," the "Creed 2" actor said on <a href=#>"In Depth with Graham Besinger"</a> on May 10. "She was married here, and went through a difficult divorce and went through a lot of stuff," Lundgren said of Krokdal, who is originally from Norway. In fact, Lundgren does not believe that age dictates a person's personal growth. "But you know, I've been with people that are twice her age that are less mature than she is," he said while adding that he feels "quite youthful."</p><p dir=ltr>Krokdal's work as a personal trainer is how the two connected, and also something brought them closer. Even though Lundgren is the older of the pair, he displays boundless energy. "When we train, he works hard, and he barely rests. Sometimes, I must tell him to rest because he's always ready to go," Krokdal told <a href=#>Muscle and Health</a>. The "Masters of the Universe" star mentioned how his fiancee's age was an advantage, as she introduced him to new training techniques.</p><p dir=ltr>Besides working in the gym together, the couple have collaborated on film projects. Krokdal was a creative consultant on Lundgren's 2021 film "Castle Falls." She also appeared in the 2023 film "Wanted Man" alongside Lundgren, and worked as a co-producer on the movie. She has also developed a relationship with Lundgren's daughters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtgaIR1g46dpqWomGK5trrDoKmepl2btqK6wp6cZp2doq5ut9Goop2ZnGKuqLGMnaCfnpWnsq%2BvxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
