The mum of two shares sons Beau, 12, and Charley, 16, with her ex-husband. <strong>"I still wish I'd done things differently because I feel like I hurt a lot of people and I'll always be sorry for that,"</strong> she added. Her 20-year marriage to Jamie unraveled after her appearance on the hit BBC show. Since their separation in 2017, Louise and Jamie have remained on good terms - the former footballer has since found love with Swedish model Frida Andersson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c3a857b65daa-louise-redknapp-ntas.jpg><p id=eF8MZVYWxUzn data-wc=164>Last year, during a <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>candid chat with HELLO!</a></strong>, Louise confessed that she will always love her ex. "I still love him," she shared. "After 21 years together how could I not still love him? <strong>He's the father of my boys. Jamie's a great dad and is very proud that our sons love me so much. He has old-fashioned values and tells them to respect and love their mum."</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>They are co-parenting their two sons in a positive way. "We have a great system co-parenting them between us," she continued. "Our rule is that while one of us is working, the other is with them. "We both want the kids all the time and encourage the other to go out so that we can have them. We share everything, too. On Christmas Day we do the presents together, they're from us both. Maybe this works now because neither of us is in a relationship, but I like to think it will always be like that."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Louise Redknapp shares glimpse of toned abs in revealing double denim look" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c3a857b65daa-louise-redknapp-ntas.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Louise Redknapp shares glimpse of toned abs in revealing double denim look" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Louise Redknapp shares glimpse of toned abs in revealing double denim look</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kevin Clifton shares stunning photo of baby Minnie - and she's Stacey Dooley's double" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1346e32762ad-stacey-dooley-kevin.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kevin Clifton shares stunning photo of baby Minnie - and she's Stacey Dooley's double" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kevin Clifton shares stunning photo of baby Minnie - and she's Stacey Dooley's double</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eRndSJBD87h data-wc=53>Louise and Jamie were granted a divorce in December 2017, and Jamie has since moved on with partner Frida Andersson, who he married in October 2021.

She told Fabulous magazine: "I haven’t spoken to him for a long time. Most probably since the show started [in 2018].Not since last year. You try and keep in touch with everybody, but it's a working environment and afterwards everyone goes and does their own thing. So it's not in a bad way and I wish him all the luck."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
