Just as importantly Britain's most famous new parents will have support as they run the gauntlet of sleepless nights and make decisions on everything from when to introduce solids to picking a nanny. In the last few years, many of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's friends have started families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c848bf896bc-rose-van-z.jpg><p id=ea08E0r93ID9 data-wc=153>Chief among the Kensington yummy mummies&nbsp;is Rose van Cutsem, (above) founder of Maggie & Rose, a safe haven for sleep deprived mothers.&nbsp;Just down the road from Kensington Palace, the members club&nbsp;boasts a soft play area, cinema snug and activity classes.&nbsp;She and&nbsp;husband&nbsp;Hugh van Cutsem&nbsp;are parents to Grace, five, Rafe, four, and an 18-month-old named Charlie. As William's&nbsp;goddaughter, their little girl was invited to be a&nbsp;bridesmaid at the <a class=hm-link href=#>royal wedding</a> in 2011. The Duchess was seen <a class=hm-link href=#>comforting Grace</a> on the balcony of Buckingham Palace&nbsp;when she took fright at the fly past.&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendship between their families goes back 40 years when Prince Charles was at Cambridge University with Hugh's father.&nbsp;According to Tatler, Kate can also turn to Marlborough school friend Trini Foyle, who has an 18-month-old son named Alexander with her husband Ted Foyle. The close friends are often seen taking Alexander for a walk in Kensington Gardens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ae4fb9c0c2ab-sam-waley-cohen-z.jpg><p id=ed_xGxTmaS1x data-wc=12>&nbsp; <strong>Sam and Bella Waley-Cohen, parents of baby Max, on their wedding day</strong></p><p id=ev3xdJnT35KA data-wc=162>Even more recent additions to the new parents club are Sam and Bella Waley-Cohen. Their son Max is just two months. Kate was at school with Sam's brother Tom, who died in 2004 and has helped with fundraising in his name, most notably at a roller disco charity event.&nbsp;Other key members of the&nbsp;future King and Queen's baby brigade are champion eventer Harry Meade and his wife Rosie. When the quartet went on a skiing holiday in March, expectant Kate stayed off the slopes in favour of cooing over their 18-month-old daughter. It was at <a class=hm-link href=#>their wedding in 2010</a> that William and Kate allowed themselves to be photographed arriving together – the first time they had done so&nbsp;on such a public occasion. This relaxed new attitude and their broad smiles&nbsp;led to accurate predictions that the royal sweethearts would be next up the aisle. The Cambridges were delighted when Rosie, a school teacher, gave birth to Lily Florence at the start of last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3a4947d2aa8c-kate-phillips-z.jpg><p id=e62S2Z4OpDi2 data-wc=14><strong>Kate keeping a watchful eye on Savannah Phillips, the daughter of William's cousin Peter</strong></p><p id=eY4moMMYheXr data-wc=86>With regards to the trendiest kids' clothes and accessories the Duchess of Cornwall's daughter-in-law, Sara Buys – the wife of her son Tom Parker-Bowles – will be a useful source. Sara is a fashion writer who is credited with introducing Kate to fashion house Alexander McQueen, which created both their wedding dresses. Camilla dotes on their children, six-year-old Lola and Freddy, three. Her daughter Laura Lopes also has three children with her husband Harry – Eliza, five, another royal bridesmaid, and three-year-old twins Gus and Louis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a52e35ca7ffd-lord-lady-windsor-z.jpg><p id=eyliEACZZrW2 data-wc=5><strong>Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor</strong></p><p id=eNISWBp-di7m data-wc=55>The first real signs of broodiness from the Duchess came when she was photographed playing with Savannah and Isla Phillips, the daughters of&nbsp;her husband's&nbsp;cousin Peter Phillips. The other birth expected in the Queen's&nbsp;family is that of Lord Freddie Windsor's child, due in August. Kate will have an ally in his wife actress <a class=hm-link href=#>Sophie Winkleman&nbsp;when it comes to finding a quiet room to breastfeed or change nappies at family gatherings.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhqYGaAcYKPbmhrcGlnfKyt055kpqGUmbmmwM6nZKmqlZy7orrTZp2roZWjsbR5z5qpnqakqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
