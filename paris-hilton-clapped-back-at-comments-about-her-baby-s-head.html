Um, hello? In no world is that fine?</p><p>Anyway, moving on. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/paris-hilton-beauty-routine/>The hotel heiress</a> recently posted a bunch of adorable photos of herself holding Phoenix (in a lil' Burberry t-shirt!) on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cylt-26pDR7/?img_index=5" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Instagram</a>, as any proud mom might do.</p><p>But as TikTok creator @stephwithdadeets pointed out in a subsequent video, the comment section on that Instagram post was so weird, with tons of grown adults commenting on the size of Phoenix' head.</p><p>Some people were making jokes about the kid's head, but others were fully trying to diagnose him with various conditions. Yes, that's right, based on a bunch of photos on Instagram. Help.</p><p>@stephwithdadeets said, "So now people have moved on to bullying a baby. A baby that most likely gets probably some of the best health care, like, ever? I'm going to take a wild guess and say Paris Hilton has probably gotten her baby checked for any and everything."</p><p>She added, "You know, he just has a big head because he has a small body and he's gonna grow into it," and concluded, "Leave Phoenix alone."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

And yes, of course he has been to a doctor, he just has a large brain."</p><p>Hope that clears things up?????</p><a title=@stephwithdadeets href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@stephwithdadeets referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@stephwithdadeets</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Stephanie Tleiji" href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7292241994016279338 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>♬ original sound - Stephanie Tleiji</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiokae2tHnHoqOtp55iwLC6jKGcmpxdmLyuucSnq6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
