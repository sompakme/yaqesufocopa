The TV star, who often shares selfies with his fans on the social media platform, posted a photo of himself wearing his trademark white-rimmed sunglasses - but with another unusual accessory…&nbsp;</p><p id=eUcmjHGnO-g data-wc=19>In the post, Howie donned a white headband with panda bear ears, and simply captioned the post: “@seeeyewear #accessories.”&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The moment that forced Howie Mandel to walk away on AGT</figure><p id=egmMxj4yeVr data-wc=39>His fans were somewhat bemused with his new look, with one writing: “Howie care to give us context?” Another person wrote: “Is there a particular look you’re trying to go for here?” A third joked: “Hey there bear hair.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eYsbiTbVSMH data-wc=53>The star recently wowed fans after donning a long, brunette hairpiece in a series of snaps, and fans were loving his new look - which was quite the change from his usual bald head! Howie, 67, previously spoke about his baldness on ABC’s 20/20, explaining: “This [baldness] feels so streamlined and so clean.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9298c9ae2230-364140734183760105330340556105739710300511983n.jpg><p id=e1OvROu799J data-wc=78>The star struggles with OCD, particularly mysophobia which is a struggle with germs. Speaking to People magazine back in 2021, he explained: “ "I was always incredibly obsessed with germs and cleaning and taking shower after shower after shower. Even when I was very young, I wouldn't tie my shoelaces because they had touched the ground. I had continuous repetitive thoughts that I couldn't get past. As a child, my mind was a lot busier than I was."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f10b5aa286d1-agt-judge-howie-mandel-looks-833742132.jpg><p id=eBn0lvdxzgHp data-wc=90>He added: “There isn't a waking moment of my life when 'we could die' doesn't come into my psyche. But the solace I would get would be the fact that everybody around me was okay. It's good to latch onto okay. But [during the pandemic] the whole world was not okay. And it was absolute hell… my life's mission is to remove the stigma [of mental illness]. I'm broken. But this is my reality. I know there's going to be darkness again -- and I cherish every moment of light."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e1rTJKUqdSEy data-wc=41>Howie has also been vocal about passing down his mental health difficulties to his daughter Jackie, who also struggles with OCD. He said: "I'm not proud of that gift I've given her. But our coping skills are to find the light."&nbsp;</p><p id=e4MFCBJPpoT- data-wc=77>Speaking about how the pandemic made her symptoms worse, Jackie added: “It was really, really hard. My anxiety sometimes leads to depression. I went through the extreme and I just locked myself in… I’ve been isolated and scared for a year and a half and now that things are starting to open back up, I'm really not at the same place that most people are. I'm working with a therapist to get back out into the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c1f132885a5-gettyimages-1243032017.jpg><p id=eFTu5BrguEBL data-wc=47>Jackie is also full of praise for her father and how he handles his mental health, explaining: "My dad is very open about going to therapy and erasing the stigma. Whenever I was upset or sad or having a bad day, I knew I could reach out.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcHFwZW58orPTZp%2Bor5maeq6xzZ2cpWWTpLunwdKeqmaekaPAbrTEmpubmZ6ZerG70q1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
