And even though she made her name with a role in Uncut Gems, the Fox that's in the spotlight today looks markedly different from the Fox that walked the red carpet for her role alongside Adam Sandler. In a new interview, Fox said that before she and West could make any public appearances together, he insisted on orchestrating a complete makeover. That explains her transformation, right down to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>the Diesel wardrobe</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>cinnamon roll-inspired denim jacket</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>appearance</a> on Call Her Daddy, Fox explained to host Alex Cooper that becoming the smoky-eyed, Schiaparelli-clad figure she is today didn't just happen overnight. Before she and West could be seen together, she said, she had to survive a rom-com style complete makeover, though fans can see that the results are less <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Miss Congeniality</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>Princess Diaries</a> and more, well, Ye. On top of everything, the process went longer than expected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was only supposed to go there for the night and then I was supposed to fly back the next day. We ended up staying three or four extra days, and it was like we were on the Kanye workout plan," she said. "We got to work. We were like, OK, we're going to do this. If I'm going to be seen with you, I need to step it up a little bit, just because I'm a little lazy."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by Marc Piasecki/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone comparing her new style to Kim Kardashian's, she sees it, too, and she'd like to point out that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Kardashian's style changed</a> after she met West. He famously cleaned out her closet, dumping all her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Hervé Léger bandage dresses</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>swapping them out</a> for swathes of neutral-hued jersey and vinyl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If anything I think the conversation should be how heavily Kim was influenced by Kanye," Fox said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She finished by saying that she's happy to go along with it all, saying that trying new things hasn't been all bad. After all, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>got a Birkin bag</a> out of it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I definitely do need to be nudged a little bit and pushed out of my comfort zone," she said during the podcast appearance. "And I love that because I don't think anyone has been able to succeed in that because I'm stubborn and I'm going to wear the things that I'm comfortable in."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qapbKdXayytMCOo6yloZFis7DEjKSYp7GVYsSmv9NmmainpGKwornPZpqapJxitaa%2BjJ2YnZypYr2wsMKaqq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
