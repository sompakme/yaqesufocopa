What are [you] doing?! The kids – all of our kids should be off limits, so stop it now. Enough is enough.”</p><p>Diana Jenkins has also shared Bravo’s message to beg social media users from commenting on Jax’s profile or other children from the housewives.</p><p><strong>If you have found this article disturbing, the Department of Psychology at the University of Georgia offers advice on dealing with racial trauma, which you can access <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.
