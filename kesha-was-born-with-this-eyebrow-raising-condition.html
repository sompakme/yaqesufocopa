Cummings told the pop star during the interview that she had just googled <a href=#>Kesha</a> for the first time, and heard that she had a tail. "Oh I do — I did," Kesha said, quickly correcting herself and adding, "A doctor stole it."</p><p dir=ltr>Huh? "I swear to God, he did not tell me he was taking my tail off, and took my tail," Kesha said. "It was very small," the singer added, likening its appearance to a mole on her back. One day, though, she thought to ask her doctor what it was, and they said that it was, in fact, technically a tail.</p><p dir=ltr>It wasn't until her 20s that the tail was removed, and it was done without Kesha's consent. "When I was getting a yearly check-up... this doctor stole my motherf***ing tail! And like, didn't ask permission, just, like, zapped it right off." Kesha seemed to be in a fairly jovial mood about the whole thing, joking that she would have liked to put it "in a case" or "on a necklace," but she did say that she missed her tail. Of course, <a href=#>Kesha has never been the most conventional pop star</a>, but the tail really is something we didn't see coming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3Flbn15e8qeqqGZXayutHnBqKmnZaeewal506GgrGWVrrKjvs6wZKuZmai2r7OMnKannJmptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
