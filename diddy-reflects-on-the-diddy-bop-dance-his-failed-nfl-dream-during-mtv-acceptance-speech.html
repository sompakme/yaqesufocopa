I saw the executives and I wanted to chase that dream. So I wanna thank every executive, every producer, every songwriter. I gotta thank the Bad Boy family ’cause without them I would not be up here. I love y’all from the bottom of my heart.” Check out Diddy's full acceptance speech below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diddy-performs-at-the-vmas>Diddy Performs At The VMAs</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition to the speech, Diddy also performed a medley of many of his most popular songs, including “I’ll Be Missing You,” “Bad Boy for Life,” “I Need a Girl” and others.
